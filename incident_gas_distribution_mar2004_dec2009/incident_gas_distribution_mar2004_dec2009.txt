THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PIPES REVEALED A STRESS FRACTURE, THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN BY THE METALLURGIST HIRED BY THE GEORGIA PSC. THE INVESTIGATION OF SOIL CONDITIONS AROUND THE GAS MAIN REVEALED THE INSTALLATION OF A SANITARY SEWER PIPE THAT INITIALLY APPEARED TO BE APPROX 10 FEET BELOW THE GAS MAIN. (AS PER ANALYSIS BY EXPERTS). SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED DATA OF A DEPTH OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SEWER BETWEEN 7.5 FEET AND 10.5 FEET BELOW THE GAS MAIN. THIS 42 INCH DIAMETER SEWER PIPE WAS INSTALLED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AFTER THE GAS MAIN WAS INSTALLED. THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS THE OPINIONS OF INVESTIGATING SOIL AND ENGINEERING EXPERTS:    THE SEWER PIPE INSTALLATION AT THE DEPTH PROBABLY INVOLVED A TRENCH 20 TO 25 FEET WIDE AT THE ELEVATION OF THE GAS MAIN.   THE BACKFILL OF THE SEWER PIPE TRENCH IS PRESENTLY IN A LOOSE CONDITION INFERRING LOOSE COMPACTION DURING PLACEMENT. AS A RESULT, THE BACKFILL CONSOLIDATED FROM UNDER THE GAS MAIN AND SETTLED AWAY FROM THE PIPE 20 FEET TO 25 FEET IN LENGTH. THE CAST IRON PIPE COULD SUPPORT THE OVERHEAD FORCES OF SOIL COVER AS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED. BUT, WHEN AN EVER INCREASING AMOUNT OF FILL WAS PLACED OVER THE GAS MAIN, THE OVERHEAD FORCES EXCEEDED THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PIPE WITH A LOSS OF SUPPORT BELOW. THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY THE PSC EXPERT REVEALED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INTACT WALL THICKNESS (87.5 % AS PER REPORT OF JAMES LANE), WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO WITHSTAND FORESEEABLE OPERATING PRESSURES AND LOADS."

THE CALL WAS DISPATCHED TO A SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT 19:04.  THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE AT 19:19.  UPON ARRIVAL, THE TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THAT GAS WAS LEAKING, REQUESTED A DISTRIBUTION CREW BE DISPATCHED, AND WORKED WITH EMERGENCY OFFICIALS TO EVACUATE BUILDINGS AS NECESSARY.  AT ABOUT 19:40, THE FOUNDATION WALL TO BUILDING N COLLAPSED AND THEN AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED.  PRIOR TO THE TECHNICIAN'S ARRIVAL, THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION WALL TO BUILDING N BUCKLED INWARD 6-8 INCHES APPARENTLY DUE TO EXTERNAL WATER PRESSURE (TORRENTIAL RAIN HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS).  THE BUCKLING OF THE FOUNDATION WALL CAUSED THE 1 1/4 INCH STEEL, 15-PSIG-DESIGN GAS SERVICE TO PULL OUT NEAR THE 3 INCH STEEL GAS MAIN AND DAMAGED GAS PIPING INSIDE OF BUILDING N.  GAS ESCAPED AND WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  THE DISTRIBUTION STAND-BY STREET LEADER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 19:42.  THE GAS WAS SHUT OFFAT 20:45 BY CLOSING TWO VALVES ON THE 3-INCH GAS MAIN. EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE GAS SERVICE AND INSIDE BUILDING N GAS PIPING WAS CAUSED BY THE BUILDING'S FOUNDATION WALL BUCKLING INWARD LIKELY FROM HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE ON THE FOUNDATION WALL.  TORRENTIAL RAIN HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS AND IS LIKELY THE TRIGGERING FACTOR TO THE FOUNDATION WALL BUCKLING AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS."

UPON ARRIVAL, WE FOUND THE FDNY ON LOCATION AND A CLASS 1000 GAS METER ON FIRE INSIDE SKYWAY AUTOBODY/REPAIR SHOP.  THE FDNY TURNED OFF THE GAS METER VALVE FOR SAFETY.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, FIRE MARSHALL DEPIZIO (BADGE #15) INFORMED US THAT THERE WAS 3 FIRES INSIDE THE SHOP (2 FIRES AT THE REAR OF THE SHOP AND 1 FIRE AT THE GAS METER AT THE FRONT OF THE SHOP).  MR. DEPRIZIO ALSO STATED THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE FIRE STARTED AT THE REAR OF THE SHOP AND TRAVELED TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE SHOP.  FIRE CHIEF WHITE (BATALLION 45) STATED THAT THE FIRE IS OF SUSPICIOUS NATURE AND THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  WE CHECKED THE AREA AND FOUND NO GAS LEAKS OR ANY INDICATION OF GAS.  THERE WAS PROPERTY DAMAGE GREATER THAN $50,000.  THE GAS METER, ELECTRIC METER, THE SHOP OFFICE, AND SOME CARS INSIDE THE SHOP WERE DAMAGED.  THERE WERE ALSO SMOKE DAMAGE TO AN ADJACENT WAREHOUSE AT #52-13 VAN DAM STREET.  THRE WERE NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATION, AND NO MEDIA ON LOCATION.  WE REMOVED THE GAS METER, LOCKED THE CURB VALVE AND HEAD OF SERVICE VALVE, AND ISSUED A WARNING TAG.  A CON EDISON PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ON LOCATION.  THIS WAS AN UPGRADGED LEVEL INCIDENT.  IT WAS RULED BY THE FDNY THAT GAS WAS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF IGNITION FOR THE BUILDING FIRE.  THEREFORE, NO FURTHER COMPANY ACTION IS REQUIRED.

A 1&1/4"" BY-PASS WAS CONSTRUCTED AROUND THE PROPOSED TEE CUT IN LOCATION TO AVOID CUSTOMER OUTAGES. INCLUDED WAS THE INSTALLATION OF A GROUNDING LINE FOR STATIC ELECTRICITY CONTROL.  NEXT, TWO MANUAL SQUEEZE OFF TOOLS WERE INSTALLED TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS IN PREPARATION FOR CUTTING OUT THE SEGMENT TO INSTALL THE NEW TEE USING TWO ELECTRO FUSION COUPLINGS FOR THE TIE-INS.  GAS WORKER THAN PROCEEDED TO USE CUTTER TOOL TO SCORE THE LINE AND CREATE A SMALL BREAK ON THE TOP OF THE MAIN TO RELEASE THE ENTRAPPED GAS. UPON COMPLETION, HE NOTICED THAT MORE GAS WAS BEING RELEASED THAN EXPECTED.  HE, AND AN ASSISTANT, PROCEEDED TO TIGHTEN DOWN THE SQUEEZE OFF TOOLS BELIEVING THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS WAS ESCAPING ONE OF THE CLAMPS.  WHILE, TIGHTENING THE 2ND CLAMP, WORKERS STATED THEY HEARD WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE GAS ESCAPING FROM THE AREA OF THE FIRST CLAMP. RECOGNIZING THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG, THEY EVACUATED THE DITCH, TURNED OFF ALL EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA AND CALLED THE COMPANY SUPERVISOR THAT THEY HAD AN UNCONTROLLED RELEASE OF GAS. COMPANY SUPERVISOR IMMEDIATELY CALLED COMPANY'S GAS DISPATCHER FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND NOTIFICATION OF A PROBLEM.  CALL TO DISPATCH WAS MADE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:10 AM.  COMPANY CREW'S ARRIVED APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES LATER.  UPON ARRIVAL, GAS & DIRT WERE BLOWING OUT OF THE DITCH 15 TO 20 FEET IN THE AIR.  WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL, AND BEFORE ANY EVALUATION OF THE CONDITION COULD BE MADE, THE GAS IGNITED.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DRY GAS COMBINED WITH DIRT RESULTED IN ENOUGH STATIC CONDITIONS TO CAUSE IGNITION. DESTROYED OR DAMAGED DURING THE PERIOD OF BURNING WAS A BACKHOE, TRUCK AND RELATED GAS EQUIPMENT & TOOLS.  TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS, THREE AREA VALVES, A 6"", 4"" AND A 2"" WERE CLOSED.  THE CLOSING OF VALVES RESULTED IN OUTAGES TO 10 CUSTOMERS.  AFTER CONTROLLING THE GAS, CREWS PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS AND RELIGHTED THE CUSTOMERS AFFECTED.  THE FIRE IN THE DITCH CONSUMED THE EXPOSED PE PIPE LEAVING LITTLE EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL CAUSE, CONDITION AND/OR PLACEMENT OF EQUIPMENT AND POST CONDITION OF PIPE.  AS OF THE WRITING OF THIS PRELIMINARY REPORT, THE CAUSE AND FAILURE MODE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  THE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURE HAS BEEN CALLED IN TO VERIFY THE CONDITION OF THE TOOLS USED, AND PREPARATIONS FOR TESTING OF THE PE PIPE IS UNDERWAY.  A POST INCIDENT REVIEW WAS HELD WITH ALL PERSONNEL INVOLVED TO COLLECT STATEMENTS AND TO REVIEW PROCEDURES USED.  UPON COMPLETION OF TESTS AND FURTHER REVIEWS, A FOLLOW UP REPORT WILL BE MADE AS TO THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN AND ANY PROCEDURAL CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE."

ONE-CALL LOCATES WERE PROPERLY MADE AT MANY DIFFERENT TIMES FOR THIS CONTRACTOR.  IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA, CONTRACTOR WAS IN PROCESS OF DOING LIME STABLIZATION TO REMOVE MOISTURE FROM GROUND IN AREA TO PREPARE FOR PAVING FOR NEW ROAD SECTION.  CONTRACTOR WAS USING RIPPER THAT EXTENDED INTO THE GROUND 16-20'.  THE RIPPER ACTUALLY HOOKED A 1"" STEEL MAIN-CURB SERVICE LINE THAT WAS NO LONGER SERVING A CUSTOMER, BUT WAS INACTIVE UNTIL THIS SEGMENT OF MAIN COULD BE ABANDONED.  THE RIPPER PHYSICALLY PULLED THE SERVICE TEE OUT OF THE TOP OF THE MAIN, CAUSING A TRIANGULAR HOLE 0.5 INCHES WIDE ON ONE END AND 1.8 INCHES WIDE ON THE OTHER, AND 10 INCHES LONGITUDINALLY IN THE TOP OF THE MAIN.  WE WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE LOCATE MARKINGS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THE RIPPER OPERATION DESTOYRED ALL OF THE PAINTED MARKINGS.  THE REASON THIS SEGMENT OF MAIN COULD NOT BE ABANDONED PRIOR TO THE ROAD CONSTRUCTION IS BECAUSE THE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE RIGHT-OF-WAY IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THE PROJECT.  ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO INSTALL APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET OF NEW 8"" PIPELINE, THIS SEGMENT OF PIPING WILL BE ABANDONED.  THE LAST REPORT GIVEN TO US BY THE STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT IS THAT THE RIGHT-OF-WAY WILL BE AVAILABLE IN MARCH, 2005.  THE AREA AROUND THE DAMAGE WAS SECURED IMMEDIATELY BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHICH HAS A STATION NEAR THE INCIDENT.  THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATLELY RESTRICTED PUBLIC TRAFFIC FROM ENTERING THE AREA.  LAWRENCEBURG GAS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF THE REPORT TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND BEGIN THE PROCESS FOR REPAIR.  NO PERSONAL INJURIES OCCURRED, AND NO CUSTOMERS LOST SERVICE DURING THIS EVENT. WE WERE ABLE TO BACKFEED THIS AREA FROM ANOTHER PART OF OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  THE DAMAGED AREA WAS REPAIRED BY PLACING A STEEL BAND OVER THE HOLE, AND PERMANENTLY WELDING A DRESSER REPAIR SLEEVE OVER THE DAMAGED AREA.  AS MENTIIONED, THIS SEGMENT OF PIPELINE WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABANDONED AFTER THE 1000 FOOT SEGMENT IS PLACED INTO SERVICE APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE FROM THE INCIDENT AREA."

IN ADDITION, THE LACK OF A SQUEEZE POINT SUPPORT CLAMP CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.  ON DECEMBER 29, 1992, PG&E REVISED ITS PLASTIC INSTALLATION STANDARDS WITH TWO RELEVANT CHANGES.  REQUIRED SUPPORT CLAMPS ON ALL EXPOSED SQUEEZE POINTS ON ALDYL ""A"" PIPE INSTALLED PROIR TO 1984.  PREVIOUSLY, THE STANDARD IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE OCTOBER 1992 INSTALLATION REQUIRED SUPPORT CLAMPS ON SQUEEZE POINTS ON ALDYL ""A"" PIPE INSTALLED PRIOR TO 1975.

THE GAS PIPELINE PARALLELS SULLIVAN RD, ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET.  THE INCIDENT WAS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT AND REQUIRED SOME INNOVATIVE PLANNING TO MAINTAIN BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERICAL CUSTOMERS (ONE BEING THE SPOKANE VALLEY MALL WHICH WAS FULL OF HOLIDAY SHOPPERS).  THE LEAK WAS ISOLATED BETWEEN A VALVE AND AN 8-INCH STOPPER THAT WAS INSTALLED, TAPPED, AND PLUGGED.  DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS WERE MAINTAINED BY BACK FEEDING DISTRIBUTION PRESSURE GAS INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE FEEDER.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS DRIVING A ONE INCH THICK, 4 FT X 12 FT STEEL PLATE INTO THE GROUND WITH A TRACK HOE TO SEAL THE END OF A SHORING BOX, WHICH WAS LOCATED ALONGSIDE OUR GAS PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR HAD BEEN WORKING WITH AVISTA AND KNEW THAT THE PIPE WAS THERE.  IN FACT, AN AVISTA INSPECTOR WAS ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  THE PLATE ""TRAVELED"" INTO THE PIPELINE AS IT WAS BEING DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND.  THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED THAT SAME DAY AND WAS BACKFILLED TO STABLIZE THE SHORING BOX.  THE PLATE SHIFTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISTRUBED SOIL.  THE PIPELINE WAS CASED IN THIS LOCATION AND THE CORNER OF THE STEEL PLATE PIERCED THE CASING AND THE PIPELINE.  OVERALL AVISTA'S RESPONSE TO THE EVENT WENT VERY WELL.  THE REPAIR WAS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT THE LEAK WAS INSIDE A CASING AND IT TOOK EXTRA TIME TO EVACUATE THE GAS AIR MIXTURE FROM WITHIN THE CASING TO AFFECT A PERMANENT REPAIR.  AN INNOVATIVE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN GAS ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMERS.

THIS DAMAGE RESULTED IN GAS ENTERING THE BUILDING AT APPROXIMATELY 52 PSIG SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE BUILDING.     THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE WAS REMOVED FROM HIS VEHICLE PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH NON-LIFE THREATENING INJURIES.  APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 MINUTES AFTER THE DAMAGE, THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE OCCURRED.  ONE OTHER MINOR INJURY OCCURRED WHEN A RESIDENT JUMPED FROM THE SECOND FLOOR AND SUSTAINED AN ARM INJURY.

THE LAKE VALLEY FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AND CONTACTED AVISTA UTILITIES AT 09:53. THE FIRE PERSONNEL SHUT OFF THE GAS AT THE SERVICE LOCKCOCK AT 10:30. AVISTA PERSONNEL ARRIVED BY 10:58 AND VERIFIED THAT THE GAS WAS SHUT OFF AND THEN HE SEALED THE LOCKCOCK. HE THEN CHECKED FOR ANY OTHER POSSIBLE LEAKS AND FOUND NONE. THE CAUSE, DETERMINED BY BOTH FIRE AND AVISTA UTILITIES PERSONNEL, WAS ICE AND SNOW BUILDUP ON THE METER SET ASSEMBLY CAUSING FAILURE OF THE METER SET PIPING BETWEEN THE SERVICE LOCKCOCK AND SERVICE REGULATOR. THE RESULTING LEAKING GAS MIGRATED UNDER THE UNOCCUPIED CABIN, IGNITED, AND EXPLODED. THE RESULTING DAMAGE WAS IN EXCESS OF $50,000. ONE INJURY WAS REPORTED BY THE MEDIA, BUT NOT TO AVISTA UTILITIES. A LOCAL NEWSPAPER ARTICLE NOTED THAT A VISITOR TO THE CAMPGROUND WAS THROWN AGAINST AN OUTSIDE WALL OF A CABIN SOME DISTANCE FROM THE ACTUAL DAMAGED CABIN, AND SENT TO HOSPITAL. AVISTA LOOKED INTO THIS AND FOUND THAT THE PERSON WAS RELEASED THE SAME DAY AND LEFT THE AREA. NO FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS INDIVIDUAL IS AVAILABLE TO AVISTA AT THIS TIME. ON FEBRUARY 7, FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY BOTH FIRE AND AVISTA PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE FORCED AIR FURNACE WAS THE CAUSE OF IGNITION. ALSO, DURING THE INVESTIGATION THE SERVICE PIPING WAS PRESSURE TESTED TO 90 PSIG AND FOUND TO HAVE NO LEAKS. BECAUSE THE SERVICE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED, IT WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE MAIN AND RETIRED. GAS ODORANT READS WERE TAKEN AT THE SITE AND FOUND WELL WITHIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS AT 0.04% AND 0.05% GAS IN AIR. RECORDS REQUESTED FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE METER SET ASSEMBLY PROVIDED AVISTA WITH DOCUMENTATION VERIFYING THE PRESSURE TEST OF THE ASSEMBLY. DAMAGE FROM THIS EXPLOSION WAS FOUND ONLY AT THIS ONE BUILDING. NO FIRE RESULTED FROM THE EXPLOSION. MEDIA, POLICE, FIRE AND AMBULANCE SERVICES RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT. NO OTHER OUTAGES OCCURRED."

COMPANY FORCES RESPONDED TO A REPORT (FROM THE NYPD) OF A POSSIBLE GAS EXPLOSION INSIDE A SUPERMARKET AND FOUND THE FDNY ON LOCATION.  AT THEIR REQUEST, WE TURNED OFF THE GAS SERVICE AT THE CURB VALVE.  WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE FDNY THAT THE STOREOWNER OF THE ASSOCIATED DELI SUPERMARKET HAD SMELLED GAS WHEN OPENING THE STORE.  WHEN THE LIGHT SWITCH WAS TURNED ON, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED AND A FIRE ENSUED.  THE FDNY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE.  A THOROUGH OUTSIDE LEAK INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED AND NO GAS READINGS WERE FOUND.  WHILE INVESTIGATING INSIDE, WE FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE GAS PIPING PULLED AWAY FROM AN OLD SPACE HEATER.  AN INTEGRITY TEST WAS PERFORMED WHICH WAS WITNESSED BY THE NY STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION & FDNY ON THE OUTSIDE GAS SERVICE FROM THE HOS VALVE TO THE CURB VALVE, AND THE TEST PASSED.  THE FIRE MARSHALL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION, AND THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION/FIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE RESULT OF FAULTY WORKMANSHIP ON THE SPACE HEATER AND THE ASSOCIATED GAS PIPING BY THE STOREOWNER'S PLUMBER.  THE STOREOWNER INDICATED THAT WORK HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON THE SPACE HEATER AND ASSOCIATED GAS PIPING AT LEAST 3 PREVIOUS TIMES IN THE VICINITY OF THE EXPLOSION/FIRE.  THE GAS PIPING AND GAS METER WERE REMOVED BY CON EDISON AT THE REQUEST OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT, AND THE HOS VALVE & CURB VALVE WERE LEFT OFF, LOCKED, AND A WARNING TAG WAS ISSUED.  THERE WERE 6 CIVILIANS (2 TAKEN TO JACOBI HOSPITAL FOR BURNS & 4 TREATED ON SITE) & 3 FIRE FIGHTERS INJURED (2 TAKEN TO JACOBI HOSPITAL, 1 TREATED ON SITE AND RELEASED).  THERE IS MAJOR INSIDE/OUTSIDE PROPERTY DAMAGE ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN $50,000.

THIS WAS A SERIOUS LEVEL INCIDENT.  IT WAS RULED BY THE FDNY THAT FAULTY WORKMANSHIP ON THE SPACE HEATER AND THE ASSOCIATED CUSTOMER OWNED GAS PIPING BY THE STOREOWNER'S PLUMBER WAS THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION/FIRE.  THIS INCIDENT DID NOT MEET CRITERIA FOR NOTIFICATION AND WE ARE CANCELING THIS VERBAL NOTICATION.  THEREFORE, NO FURTHER COMPANY ACTION IS REQUIRED.

THE BUILDING WAS ON FIRE AT ABOUT 1:12PM.  GAS TRUCK #3 WAS IN HEMPHILL GETTING GAS READINGS.  SO HE CALLED GAS TRUCK #4 TO RESPOND TO THE SCENE; HE WAS CLOSER.    IN THE MEANTIME, GAS TRUCKS #2 AND #6 WERE AT THE BANTAM MARKET WHICH IS ABOUT 200 FEET AWAY FROM THE SCENE.    GAS TRUCK #6 WENT BEHIND THE BUILDING TO CUT GASS OFF AT THE METER.  HE DID NOT KNOW THE GAS LINE WAS ON FIRE AT THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING.  THE FLAMES WERE TO HOT FOR HIM TO CUT THE METER OFF SO HE WENT BACK AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING.    BOBBY BOWMAN, WELCH CHIEF OF POLICE SHOWED UP STOPPING ALL TRAFFIC.    THEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME AND STARTED SPRAYING WATER ON THE BUILDING.    GAS TRUCK #4 ARRIVES ON THE SCENE.  HE SEES THAT SPRAYING WATER DOESN'T HELP SO HE REALIZES THE GAS LINE IS ON FIRE.  HE THEN PUTS A SQUEEZE OFF ON THE 3/4"" GAS LINE TO SHUT IT OFF.    HE ESTIMATES THE GAS HAD BEEN BLOWINGFOR AN ESTIMATED 7-10 MINUTES.    GAS TRUCK #3 ARRIVES ON THE SCENE AND TALKS TO BOBBY BOWMAN AND GAS TRUCK #4 ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE FIRE.  WHILE STANDING THERE WE SEE MR. THOMAS, WORKER FOR GLEM CORPORATION CARRYING A PROPANE TANK AND TORCH AROUND BEHIND THE BUILDING AND LATER HE PUT IT IN HIS OWN TRUCK.  I ASKED WHAT HAPPENED.  HE SAID HE JUST GOT BACK FROM LUNCH AND FIRED HIS TORCH UP AND THAT'S ALL HE KNOWS.  HE SAID THERE WAS A GAS LEAK OR SOMETHING.  I TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO GAS LEAK THAT HE LAID HIS TORCH ON THE GAS LINE.  HE REPLIED, ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.""    THE OWNER OF THE NEW BUILDING THAT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION HAD MADE A REQUEST TO HAVE THE GAS LINE LOCATED AND MARKED SO HIS CONTRACTORS WOULD KNOW WHERE THE GAS LINE WAS AND COULD AVOID IT.  THIS REQUEST WAS ANSWERED AND THE GAS LINE WAS UNCOVERED AND MAKED BY SIGNS READING ""GAS LINE - DANGER"".  THE REQUEST TO LOCATE AND THE ACTUAL LOCATING AND MARKING OF GAS LINES IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA ARE MANDATED BY STATE LAW.  THE LAWS WERE FOLLOWED BY BOTH THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE GAS CO-OP.      SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WERE SAID AND DONE TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

A SERVICE LATERAL FOR THIS CORNER PROPERTY WAS INSTALLED FROM THE SIDE OF THE HOME FACING WHITALL AVENUE, AS THERE WAS NO EXISTING GAS MAIN ON SHAR LANE BOULEVARD.  (A FORMER 2"" BARE STEEL GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN ALONG SHAR LAN BOULEVARD HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RETIRED AND ABANDONED FROM SERVICE IN 1975.  THIS RETIREMENT WAS EFFECTED BY CUTTING AND CAPPING THE EXISTING 2"" MAIN ON WHITALL AVENUE NEAR IT'S INTERSECTION WITH SHAR LANE BOULEVARD.)  IN THE COURSE OF ATTEMPTING TO ENERGIZE THE CONNECTION OF THE NEW SERVICE LATERAL TO THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN ON WHITALL AVENUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO 708 SHAR LANE BOULEVARD, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PROPOSED CONNECTION POINT ON THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN WAS NOT ALONG A SECTION OF ACTIVE MAIN, BUT RATHER WAS LOCATED ON THE PREVIOUSLY RETIRED ADJACENT SECTION WHICH EXISTED ALONG WHITALL AVENUE.  THEREFORE THE 1994 INSTALLATION CREW INSERTED THE 3/4"" POLYETHYLENE SERVICE INTO THE ABANDONED 2"" BARE STEEL MAIN ALONG WHITALL AVENUE FOR A DISTANCE OF 48', WHICH REPRESENTED THE DEAD-END LOCATION OF THE EXISTING ACTIVE MAIN ON WHITALL AVENUE.  AT THIS POINT THEY EXCAVATED AND RE-CONNECTED THE END OF THE INSERTED SERVICE LINE TO THE TERMINUS OF THE EXISTING MAIN.  THIS SERVICE LINE INSERTION TECHNIQUE WHITHIN THE ABANDONED 2"" DISTRIBUTION MAIN ON WHITALL AVENUE WAS RECORDED ON THE AS-BUILT SERVICE RECORD CARD DOCUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE INSTALLATION FOR 708 SHAR LANE BOULEVARD.  THIS SAME SERVICE LINE INSERTION WAS NOT RECORDED ON THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN RETIREMENT RECORD FROM 1975.  IN 2005, TWO NEW REQUESTS FOR GAS SERVICE WERE RECEIVED FOR ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES ALONG SHARE LANE BOULEVARD WHICH NECESSITATED AS DISTRIBUTION MAIN EXTENSION FROM THE TERMINUS OF THE EXISTING MAIN ON WHITALL AVENUE TO SHAR LANE BOULEVARD, AND THENCE ALONG SHAR LANE BOULEVARD FOR A TOTAL DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 307'.  THE LAYOUT AND DESIGN OF THIS PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION MAIN EXTENSION WAS PERFORMED IN THE FIELD BY AN EXPERIENCED COMPANY CONSTRUCTION INSPECTOR, WHO ROUTINELY PERFORMES THIS TYPE OF WORK, ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED INSPECTION ACTIVITIES OF SUB-CONTRACTOR INSTALLATION CREWS TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.  AS PART OF HIS PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION MAIN EXTENSION LAYOUT AND DESIGN DUTIES, THE INSPECTOR OBSERVED THE LOCATIONS OF THE EXISTING METERS SUPPLYING SERVICE TO THE TWO CORNER PROPERTIES KNOWN AS 708 AND 800 SHAR LANE BOULEVARD.  THE INSPECTOR ALSO OBSERVED FIELD LOCATION MARKOUTS DEPICTING THE LOCATIONS OF THE EXISTING SUB-SURFACE GAS MAIN AND SERVICES, AND INCORPORATED THESE OBSERVATIONS INTO HIS PROPOSED MAIN EXTENTION LAYOUT DESIGN.  THE INSPECTOR DID NOT CROSS-CHECK THE SERVICE RECORD CARDS ON FILE IN THE DIVISIONAL OFFICE DEPICTING THE AS-BUILT INSTALLATION DETAILS FOR EITHER OF THE CORNER PROPERTIES, INSTEAD RELYING ON HIS EXPERIENCE AND THE FIELD LOCATION MARKOUTS WHICH ACCURATELY DEPICTED THE UNDERGROUND LOCATIONS OF THE SUB-SURFACE GAS FACILITIES.    ON JULY 21, 2005, UTILITY LINE SERVICE (ULS), THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTOR FOR THE CUMBERLAND DIVISION WAS COMPLETING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE 2"" POLYETHYLENE DISTRUBUTION MAIN EXTENSION ON SHAR LANE BOULEVARD AND WAS PREPARING TO MAKE A TIE-IN INTO THE 2"" BARE STEEL MAIN ON WHITEALL AVENUE.  THE ULS CREW EXCAVATED AND PREPARED THE 2"" BARE STEEL MAIN FOR A WELDED TIE-IN AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF WELDING ON A 2"" MUELLER NO-BLOW TEE PIECE WHEN THE INSERTED PLYETHYLENE SERVICE LINE FAILED, AND GAS ESCAPED THROUGH AREAS OF CORROSION OF THE STEEL MAIN WHICH WAS ACTING AS A CASING FOR THE INSERTED SERVICE LINE.  THE ESCAPING GAS IGNITED WITHIN THE TIE-IN EXCAVATION AREA, AND THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WELDING SUFFERED FIRST A ND SECOND DEGREE BURNS.  A CREW MEMBER PROVIDING EVACUATION ASSISTANCE TO THE WELDER OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AREA SUFFERED FIRST DEGREE BURNS.SOUTH JERSEY GAS COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY OF THE IGNITION AT 1100 HOURS AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1100 HOURS.  THE CONTROLLING VALVE WAS LOCATED AND SHUT DOWN AT 1135 HOURS TERMINATING GAS FLOW TO THE IGNITION SITE.  LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PROVIDED FIRE SUPRESSION, TRAFFIC CONTROL AND MEDICAL EVACUATION SERVICES FOR THE TWO INJURED CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES.  ONE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED.  THE OTHER EMPLOYEE WAS ADMITTED AND RETAINED OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION PURPOSES, AND WAS RELEASED THE NEXT MORNING."

UPON ARRIVAL ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2005 AT ABOUT 2220 HOURS I OBSERVED THAT THE MOBILE HOME DWELLING APPEARD TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AN EXPLOSION AND THE REMAINING STRUCTURE INDICATED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS LIKELY INVOLVED.  AT THIS TIME AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED.    IN MY INVESTIGATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 5/8"" COPPER SERVICE LINE THAT LIES BETWEEN THE GAS METER AND THE MOBILE HOME HAD BEEN CUT WITH A PIPE CUTTER AND INSERTED INTO A DRILLED HOLE IN THE REAR OF THE MOBILE HOME.  THE DRILLED HOLE WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE MOBILE HOME WALL JUST ABOVE FLOOR LEVEL.  THIS OBSERVATION WAS REPORTED TO THE NEBRASKA STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE TO INVESTIGATOR JACK MALICKY.    SHORTLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY I INTERVIEWED IRVINGTON FIRE CHIEF NOLAN PAULSEN WHO WAS THE FIRST RESPONDER ON THE SCENE.  ACCORDING TO FIRE CHIEF NOLAN PAULSEN HE WAS INVESTIGATING A GAS LEAK AROUND THE AREA OF THIS MOBILE HOME.  AT 2135 HOURS HE HAD A 911 OPERATOR CONTACT MUD DISPATCHERS AND REQUEST ASSISTANCE FROM MUD IN LOCATING AND ELIMINATING THIS LEAK.  AT 2140 HOURS CHIEF PAULSEN NOTIFIED A 911 OPERATOR HE NEEDED FIRE AND RESCUE PERSONNEL BECAUSE THE MOBILE HOME HAD SUFFERED AN EXPLOSION AND WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.    FROM THE INFORMATION GATHERED AT THE SCENE AND STATEMENTS FROM THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, IT IS APPARENT THAT THERE IS NO LIABILITY ON BEHALF OF MUD AND OUR INVESTIGATION IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER IS CLOSED.     SEPTEMBER 27, 2005 SUPPLEMENTAL ADDITION: THE TWO OCCUPANTS, LINDA AND KEN TOPPING, HAVE BOTH DECEASED FROM THEIR INJURIES FROM THIS INCIDENT.     THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT AFFECT OR CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF OUR INVESTIGATION. OUR INVESTIGATION AGAIN REVEALS THAT THERE IS NOT RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE METROPOLITAN UTITLITIES DISTRICT."

MEAGOR - DOT COORDINATOR MONTANA	4064972214	KEITH.MEAGOR@NORTHWESTERN.COM	"5/4/09 - THIS WILL BE THE FINAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT.  A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR THAT WAS EXCAVATING FOR A SEWER PROJECT FOR THE CITY OF LIVINGSTON DAMAGED A SERVICE LINE THAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT.  THIS INCIDENT REPORT SHOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED CLOSED WITH NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED.    FORM PHMSA F 7100.1, PART G (NARRATIVE)    THE CITY OF LIVINGSTON HAS A SEWER LINE REPLACEMENT PROJECT ON-GOING IN TEH CITY.  THE ALLEY BEHIND 100 SOUTH L STREET WAS PART OF THIS PROJECT.  THE GAS LINE LOCATE REQUEST WAS RECEIVED ON 8/31/2005.  LOCATES WERE MADE WITHING 2 DAYS.  THE REQUEST START DATE WAS 9/3/2005.  THE EXCAVATOR ONLY EXPOSED THE GAS SERVICE LINES WHERE THEY CROSSED THE SEWER PROJECT AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT.  ON 9/14/05, THE SEWER DITCH WAS BACKFILLED WITHOUT COMPACTION BECAUSE THE SEWER CONTRACTOR'S COMPACTION DEVICE WAS INOPERABLE.    BEFORE 0800 HOURS ON 9/15/2005 NORTHWESTERN ENERGY (NWE) RECEIVED A CALL ON A LOCAL CELL PHONE, NOT THE ONE CALL SYSTEM, ASKING FOR RE-LOCATES IN THIS ALLEY.  THE SEWER CONTRACTOR WAS RE-EXCAVATING THE SEWER MAIN TO PROPERLY COMPACT THE DITCH.  AT 0834 HOURS, THE CONTRACTOR MADE A SECOND CALL AND LEFT A VOICE MAIL MESSAGE ON THE SAME LOCAL CELL NUMBER STATING THAT A GAS LINE HAD BEEN HIT.    THE SERVICEMAN WAS ON THE PHONE WITH BOZEMAN DISPATCH WHEN THE SECOND CALL CAME IN, AND WAS ON SITE WITH THE CONTRACTOR BEFORE HE COULD RETURN THE CALL MADE AT 0834 HOURS, 3 TO 4 MINUTES HE REMAINED ON SITE UNTIL THE EXPLOSION.  THE SEWER CONTRACTOR EXPOSED THE HIT SERVICE LINE BEFORE THE SERVICEMAN ARRIVED, BUT THE BREAK WAS NOT EXPOSED (~24"" AWAY).    OTHER CREW MEMBERS ARRIVED, ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND LEFT TO GATHER EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL OVER THE NEXT HOUR.  AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, 1010 HOURS, THE CREW WAS STASRTING TO EXPOSE THE BREAK.    A BYSTANDER, WHO IS ALSO A MEMEBER OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, NOTIFIED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BY RADIOI OF THE INCIDENT.  BURNING DEBRIS IGNITED THE GAS AT THE SITE OF EXCAVATION.  THE STSRUCTURE THAT EXPLODED WAS BURNING, AS WELL.  TWO OTHER STRUCTURES WERE DAMAGED IN THE EXPLOSION.    FOUR NWE EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN THE BLAST, BUT NOT HOSPITALIZED.  ONE MEMBER OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS INJURED IN THE STRUCTURE THAT EXPLODED AND HOSPITALIZED.    AFTER THE AREA WAS RELEASED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE BREAK IN THE SERVICE LINE WAS FOUND TO BE THE ONLY SOURCE OF GAS.  THE SERVICE LINE SHOWS SEVERAL POINTS OF CONTACT FROM EXCAVATION AND WAS BENT WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE SEWER MAIN DITCH BEING EXCAVATED, INDICATING HAVING BEEN PULLED OR PUSHED DURING EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE BROKE CIRCUMFERENTIALLY MORE THAN HALF WAY AROUND THE PIPE AT THE THREADS ENTERING A FITTING.  THIS SERVICE LINE DID NOT SERVE THE STRUCTURE THAT EXPLODED, BUT A HOUSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ALLEY.  THE GAS MAY HAVE MIGRATED ALONG A SEWER SERVICE.  THOUGH NO GAS WAS FOUND ALONG THIS ROUTE DURING INVESTIGATION.  THE SOIL ALONG THIS SEWER LINE SERVING THE DAMAGED STRUCTURE WAS DRY AND LOOSELY COMPACTED (GRAVEL) COMPARED TO THE SURROUNDING SOIL.  IF THE GAS MIGRATED ALONG THE SEWER SERVICE, IT THEN MAY HAVE MIGRATED THROUGH THE FOUNDATION WALL, COLLECTED AND FOUND A SOURCE OF IGNITION."

THE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE GAS VALVE AT THE CURB, BUT WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE VALVE. AN INSPECTOR ARRIVED ON SITE AT 09:30. AFTER MEETING THE TECHNICIAN, THE INSPECTOR CALLED HEADQUARTERS AND REQUESTED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. THE TECHNICIAN THEN WALKED TOWARD THE BUILDING WITH HIS GAS DETECTOR TO ASCERTAIN GAS LEVEL READINGS. AS THE TECHNICIAN WAS OBTAINING A GAS READING OF 0.2% IN OPEN AIR NEAR THE BOILER ROOM DOOR, THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED. A PORTION OF THE 24 UNIT THREE STORY BUILDING WAS DESTROYED IN THE EXPLOSION AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BUILDING CAUGHT FIRE. AFTER THE EXPLOSION, BOTH THE TECHNICIAN AND THE INSPECTOR ASSISTED THE INJURED AND SUPPORTED EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. THE CURB GAS VALVE WAS CLOSED AT 10:00 AFTER ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL ARRIVED. PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EXCAVATION WORK, THE GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN ACCURATELY MARKED BY PSE&G IN ACCORDANCE WITH NEW JERSEY'S UNDERGROUND FACILITY PROTECTION ACT.

UPON ARRIVAL WE FOUND A FIRE WITH EXTENSIVE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO 3304 AND 3306 N. HOPE STREET, ALSO DAMAGED WERE 3302 AND 3308.  THERE WAS A GAS FIRE APPROXIMATELY 12 FEET WEST OF THE WEST BUILDING LINE AND ALONG THE SOUTH BUILDING WALL OF 3304 COMING FROM THE BASEMENT.  BRICKS, DOORS AND WINDOWS WERE BOWN OUTWARD INTO THE STREET.  ADDITIONALLY, WE FOUND A SLIGHT ODOR OF GAS AND A 60 LEL READING COMING FROM THE RUBBLE INSIDE OF THE PROPERTY NEAR WHERETHE HEAD OF SERVICE WOULD HAVE BEEN (THE AREA OF THE HEAD OF SERVICE WAS NOT ACCESSIBLE).  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT ASSISTED IN MOVING DEBRIS FROM IN FRONT OF 3304.    PGW RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE 1"" PLASTIC CURB VALVE WAS TURNED OFF ON JULY 15,2005.  PGW PERSONNEL FOUND THIS VALVE IN THE ON POSITION.  AT THAT TIME WE TURNED THE VALVE OFF AND THE FIRE ON THE SOUTH WALL DECREASED IN INTENSITY AND THE LEL READING DISSIPATED.  PGW CREWS MADE MIGRATION CHECKS, EXCAVATED AND PROBED ALONG THE MAIN AND THE SERVICES AND FOUND NO INDICATION OF AN UNDERGROUND LEAK IN THE AREA OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE SERVICE LINES AT THE MAIN CONNECTION TO 3302, 3304 AND 3306 WERE THEN ABANDONED.    ALL SERVIE LINES WERE INSTALLED IN 1989 AND WERE CONNECTED TO A 4"" CATHODICALLY PROTECTED STEEL MAIN ALSO INSTALLED AT THAT TIME.  ALL SERVICE CONNECTIONS AT THE MAIN WERE IN GOOD CONDITION AND WE FOUND NO INDICATION OF LEAKS IN THE AREA OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE SERVICE LINE TO 3302 WAS TESTED AND HELD AN AIR TEST AT OPERATING PRESSURE.  THE PROPERTIES AT 3304 AND 3306 WERE STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE CONDITION AT THIS TIME TO ALLOW ACCESS TOTHE HEAD OF THE SERVICE CONNECTION.  THIS WORK WAS CONDUCTED IN THE PRESENCE OF  PUC GAS SAFETY INSPECTORS CLYDE W. STANLEY, AND NGHI NGUYEN.

THE AMERENUE CONTRACTOR COMPLETED THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT BY REPLACING THE EXISTING CAST IRON MAINS AND STEEL SERVICES. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT INVOLVED CONVERTING A LOW PRESSURE AREA WHICH HAD EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS AND SERVICES TO 10 PSIG. THE EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS AND SERVICES HAD AN ESTABLISHED MAOP OF 60 PSIG. THIS REQUIRED SEPARATING A SECTION OF THE EXISTING POLYETHYLENE MAINS FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM, ADDING REGULATORS TO EACH METER IN THE SECTION, AND CONNECTING THE SECTION TO AN ADJACENT 10 PSIG GAS SOURCE. THE SECTION TO BE CONVERTED WAS SIZED TO ALLOW FOR THE COMPLETION OF WORK BY THE AMERENUE CONTRACTOR WITHIN A SINGLE DAY TO MINIMIZE GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTION.       INCIDENT INFORMATION: THE CONTRACTOR BEGAN THE MORNING BY PERFORMING WORK TO ISOLATE THE SYSTEM TO BE CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. DURING THIS TIME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTOR CREW MEMBERS WENT TO EACH OF THE THIRTEEN METER LOCATIONS DESIGNATED BY AMERENUE AS PART OF CONVERSION TO SHUT OFF SERVICE AND TO REMOVE THE METER FROM THE INLET PIPING. AN AMERENUE INSPECTOR WAS WITNESSING THIS ACTIVITY AND CHECKED EACH SERVICE OFF OF A LIST ONCE THE WORK WAS COMPLETED.     THE CONTRACTOR COMPLETED THE WORK TO ISOLATE THE SYSTEM AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM. THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR, AMERENUE INSPECTOR, AND THE CONTRACTOR FOREMAN MET AGAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30AM TO REVIEW THE WORK COMPLETED TO THIS POINT AND TO REVIEW THE PLANS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM. THEY REVIEWED THE CONSTRUCTION PRINTS AND DISCUSSED THE MAIN SEPARATION LOCATIONS, TIE-IN LOCATIONS, AND THE THIRTEEN SERVICE LOCATIONS THAT WERE SEPARATED. ALL WERE IN AGREEMENT THAT THEY WERE READY TO PROCEED WITH THE NEXT STEP OF INTRODUCING 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM.      AT APPROXIMATELY 11:35 AM, A VALVE WAS OPENED TO INTRODUCE THE 10 PSIG INTO THE SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:53 AM, THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR OVERHEARD THE AMERENUE DISPATCHER CALLING AN AMERENUE SERVICEMAN TO RESPOND TO A GAS PRESSURE PROBLEM AT A RESTAURANT AT 415 ASHLEY ROAD IN BOONVILLE. THE   AMERENUE SUPERVISOR RECOGNIZED THE RESTAURANT WAS LOCATED ON THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM JUST NORTH OF THE AREA THAT WAS BEING CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG. HE SUSPECTED THERE MUST BE A PROBLEM RESULTING FROM THE SYSTEM CONVERSION SO HE CALLED THE AMERENUE INSPECTOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM TO CLOSE THE VALVE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OPENED. THE INSPECTOR HAD LEFT THE JOB SITE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SO HE CONTACTED THE CONTRACTOR BY CELL PHONE AND INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE VALVE. THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR RETURNED TO THE JOB SITE AND INSTRUCTED THE CONTRACTOR TO OPEN METER SERVICE VALVES IN THE AREA AND CUT A CAP OFF OF AN EXPOSED POLYETHYLENE MAIN TO RELIEVE THE 10 PSIG OF PRESSURE FROM THE SYSTEM.        THE AMERENUE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE AMERENUE SUPERINTENDENT, ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS AND NOTIFIED HIM OF THE SITUATION AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10 PM.  THE SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED AMERENUE SUPERVISOR TO SEND AMERENUE GAS PERSONNEL TO THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATOR STATIONS TO BLEED THE PRESSURE OFF OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS AFFECTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS PRESSURIZED TO 10 PSIG SO THE SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED THE SUPERVISOR TO SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATE THE ENTIRE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.      THE SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT BOONVILLE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:50PM. AT THAT TIME THE AFFECTED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS DEPRESSURIZING AND WAS AT A PRESSURE OF 0-1 PSIG.     AT APPROXIMATELY 1:30 PM AMERENUE GAS PERSONNEL BEGAN SHUTTING OFF THE METERS THAT SERVED THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS ISOLATED. ADDITIONAL A MERENUE GAS PERSONNEL FROM OTHER LOCATIONS WERE CALLED TO ASSIST. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 750 CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY ISOLATING THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.     AMERENUE INVESTIGATED AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE OVER PRESSURIZATION. IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT A 4 MAIN CONNECTING THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM TO BE CONVERTED TO 10 PSIG WAS OVERLOOKED AND WAS NOT SEPARATED PRIOR TO INTRODUCING THE 10 PSIG.

AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT OR WHY IT OCCURRED. A PARTIALLY CIRCUMFRENTIAL CRACK WAS FOUND ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE THREAD ROOT OF A SERVICE LINE AFTER THE INCIDENT BUT IT IS NOT NOW KNOWN WHETHER THIS WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCIDENT OR ONE OF THE FACTORS LEADING TO ITS CAUSE. WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER NATURAL GAS WAS THE FIRST FUEL IGNITED OR WHETHER SOME OTHER FUEL WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.     A COOPERATIVE, COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION,OF THE INCIDENT SCENE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE COMPANY AND VARIOUS AGENCIES REPRESENTING AFFECTED PARTIES.    CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FILED BY THE COMPANY AND AFFECTED PARTIES, BASED UPON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN  AND ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER MODIFICATION OR ELABORATION.    PROTOCOL FOR METALLURGICAL EVALUATION OF THE CRACKED GAS SERVICE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED PARTIES FOR FINAL APPROVAL.

UPDATED BY PHMSA ON 12/16/2015 PER OPERATOR'S MARK UP (PART A, QUESTION 4  TYPE OF LEAK OR RUPTURE; PART C, QUESTION 1  INCIDENT OCCURRED ON; PART C, QUESTION 2  FAILURE OCCURRED ON; PART F  APPARENT CAUSE; AND PART G - NARRATIVE).    THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THE INCIDENT RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS:  THE GAS LEAK OCCURRED FROM A FRACTURE AT THE THREADED JOINT OF A SERVICE VALVE ON THE BARE STEEL PORTION OF THE GAS SERVICE.  NYSEG DETERMINED THE FRACTURE WAS CAUSED BY A UNIQUE CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS.  FIRST, THE WATER DEPARTMENT STRUCK AND DAMAGED THE GAS SERVICE WHILE INSTALLING A DRYWELL ADJACENT TO THE GAS SERVICE.  THE FORCE FROM THE BACKHOE, BOTH DURING THE DIGGING AND BACKFILL PROCESS, CREATED A DOWNWARD FORCE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GAS PIPELINE FAILURE.  SECOND, REPEATED BREAKS IN THE WATER MAIN IN DIRECT PROXIMITY OF THE HOME CONTRIBUTED TO SOIL SUBSIDENCE UNDERNEATH THE GAS SERVICE, DUE TO FLOODING WATER WASHING AWAY FINE PARTICLES WHICH ERODED THE SOIL SUPPORT UNDERNEATH THE GAS PIPE.  THIRD, ADDITIONAL UNDERMINING OF THE GAS SERVICE WAS CAUSED BY WATER FLOW INTO AND OUT OF THE SEWER MAIN THROUGH CRACKS AND LEAKY JOINTS, WHICH WASHED AWAY THE DIRT THAT SUPPORTED THE GAS SERVICE.  THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE COMBINATION OF THESE EVENTS EVENTUALLY LED TO THE FAILURE OF THE GAS SERVICE."

BARLETT AVENUE, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN.  WHILE COMPLETING THE LEAK SURVEY ON THE INSIDE METER SET, HE FOUND A SMALL LEAK IN THE AREA OF A PIPE ON THE END OF A 2 INCH TEE LOCATED BETWEEN THE END OF THE GAS SERVICE PIPE ENTRY POINT AND THE SERVICE REGULATOR (GAS IN AIR READING TAKEN WAS 0.65 OF 1% AT THE THREADED REGION OF THE PLUG).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES, HE CALLED IN THE LEAK TO GAS DISPATCH AT 2:15PM AND GRADED IT AS A GRADE 2 LEAK (THE COMPANY DEFINES A GRADE 2 LEAK AS ""A LEAK THAT IS RECOGNIZED AS BEING NON-HAZARDOUS AT THE TIME OF DETECTION, BUT REQUIRES SCHEDULED REPAIR BASED ON POSSIBLE FUTURE HAZARD"").  GAS DISPATCH, IMMEDIATELY SCHEDULED A FIELD WORK ORDER TO REPAIR THE LEAK.  AT 4:38PM THAT SAME AFTERNOON, GAS DISPATCHRECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SERVICE FITTER WHO TOOK THE WORK ORDER TO FIX THE LEAK THAT HE HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  HE INFORMED DISPATCH THAT THE HUSE BLEW UPAND WAS ON FIRE.  IN ADDITION, HE REQUESTED THAT A CONSTRUCTIONAND REPAIR (C & R) CREW BE SENT TO ASSIST IN TURNING OFF THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE BUILDING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:15PM, GAS DISPATCH RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE C & R  CREW THAT THE GAS SUPPLY TOT HE BUILDING HAD BEEN SHUT OFF AT THE CURB VALVE TO THE BUILDING AND THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT NOW HAD CONTROL OF THE FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING THE REMAINING 4 ADJACENT UNITES OF THE 6 UNITS APARTMENT COMPLEX.    DRUING THE FOLLOWING WEEK OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY CONDUCTED A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW PROCESS.  AS PART OF THAT REVIEW, A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE EMPLOYEE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO ARRIVED AT THE SCENE TO ASSIST THE EMPLOYEE AND/OR THE EMERGENCY CREWS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEWS, AND STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY'S SERVICE FITTER INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT, THE FOLLOWING RECONSTRUCTION OF ACTIONS TAKEN AFTER THE EMPLOYEE ARRIVED TO REMEDIAATE THE LEAK WAS MADE:    AFTER ARRIVING AT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX AND VERIFING THE LOCATIONAND PRESENCE OF THE LEAK REPORTED, THE EMPLOYEE MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO TIGHTEN THE PIPE PLUG, BUT FAILED TO STOP THE LEAK.  HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO BACK OFF THE PLUG AND APPLY PIPE DOPE TOT HE THREADED AREA TO CREATE A BETTER LEAK SEAL.  HIS FIRST ATTEMPT FAILED TO STOP THE LEAK AND DURING THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO RE-DOPE THE THREADS, THE  PIPE PLUG FELL FREE.  WITH GAS NOW ESCAPING, HE ATTEMPTED TO RE-THREAD THE PIPE PLUG BACK INTO THE TEE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEINING AN ADJACENT WINDOW TO VENTILATE THE ESCAPING GAS.  UNABLE TO COMPLETE EITHER TASK, THE BASEMENT ROOM QUICKLY FILLED WITH AN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE OF GAS.  IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT IGNITED THE MIXTURE, BUT SOURCES OF POTENTIAL IGNITION WERE PRESENT SUCH AS FURNACES AND WATER HEATERS.  THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION APPARENTLY KNOCKED HIM TO THE FLOOR AND HIS NEXT RECOLLECTION WAS FINDING HIMSELF LYING ON THE FLOOR LOOKING UP AND SEEING FLAMES ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING JOISTS.  HE IMMEDIATELY MADE HIS WAY UP THE STAIRS WHERE HE WAS MET BY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS ALREADY EXITING THE BUILDING.  EVEN THOUGH EH SUFFERED 2ND DEGREE BURNES PRIMARILY TO HIS FACIAL AREA, HE CONTINUED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE RESIDENCES WERE EVACUATED WHILE MAKING HIS EMERGENCY CALL BACK TO GAS DISPATCH SEEKING HELP.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, EVENTUALLY RECOGNIZING THE MAN WAS INJURED, LED HIM TO AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE WHERE HE WAS TRASPORTED TO A NEARBY HOSPITAL AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED THAT SAME EVENING FOR BURN INJURIES.    COMPANY ACTONS TAKEN FOLOWING THE INCIDENT    TWO SAFETY RELATED INITIATIVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO PLACE:       (1)  A COMPANY WIDE NOTIFICATION WAS SENT OUT TO ALL GAS OPERATING PERSONNEL ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4TH, 2006 THAT GAS FIELD PERSONNEL WORKING ON INSIDE GAS FACILITIES SHALL NOT DISTURB ANY PIPING THAT DOES NOT HAVE A READILY ACCESSIBLE CONTROL VALVE.  MORE SPECIFICALLY: REPAIRS UPSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR-THE U PSTEAM VALVE MUST BE SHUT OFF.  FOR REPAIRS DOWNSTEAM OF THE REGULATOR, THE UPSTEAM VALVE MUST BE READILY ACCESSIBLE AND OPERABLE.       (2)  A SERVICE FITTER REFRESHER TRAINING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.  THE TRAINING WILL REVIEW SAFETY PROCEDURES, INCLUDE SCENARIO DISCUSSIONS TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS, AND INCLUDE A TEST AT THE END AND THE SCORES REVIEWED.  ALL TRAINING SESSIONS ARE TO BE COMPLETED BY JANUARY 31, 2006."

INVESTIGATIONS BY BOTH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND A FIRE INVESTIGATOR HIRED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. BOTH OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE LIKELY STARTED AT THE RISER /MSA LOCATION.    UPON THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S ARRIVAL, THE REGULATOR AND MSA WERE NOT ATTACHED TO THE RISER, AND THE RISER WAS BLOWING FULL OPEN. THE FIRE DEPT CLOSED THE RISER AND THEN WORKED ON EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE WHICH HAD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, LIKELY VIA THE ATTIC.     UPON THE GAS COMPANY'S ARRIVAL, THE GAS WAS ALREADY SHUT OFF, AND WE WERE NOT GRANTED ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY UNTIL FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS WERE COMPLETED.    IT IS STILL UNKNOWN HOW THE MSA AND REGULATOR WERE KNOCKED OFF THE RISER, ALLOWING GAS TO ESCAPE AT DISTRICT PRESSURE (APPROX 40 TO 50 PSI.) THE MSA WAS IN A LOCATION THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW A STRIKE BY VEHICULAR TRAFFIC . THERE IS SPECULATION THAT HIGH WINDS MAY HAVE BLOWN SOMETHING AGAINST THE MSA, BUT THIS COULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIATED.

THE COLLISION CAUSED ONE VEHICLE TO CAREEN OFF THE ROAD AND STRIKE A BARRICADED METER SET ASSEMBLY, BREAKING PIPING ABOVE THE LOW PRESSURE SIDE OF THE DOMESTIC REGULATOR.  THE ESCAPING GAS IGNITED, BURNING AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE VEHICLE.     SOCALGAS RESPONDED, CONTROLLING THE GAS AND REPAIRING THE DAMAGED METER SET ASSEMBLY, AND REPLACING DAMAGED BARRICADES.  SERVICE TO CUSTOMER WAS RESTORED.     INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS RESULT OF AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT THAT SENT 2 VEHICLES OFF-ROAD AND INTO AN ADJACENT GRAPE VINEYARD.  ONE VEHICLE DROVE THROUGH STOP SIGN AND THROUGH GUARD RAILS TO STRIKE METER SET ASSEMBLY THAT WAS PLACED OFF THE ROADWAY ADJACENT TO ROWS OF GRAPEVINES.     THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SAFETY AND RELIABILITY SECTION IS SCHEDULED TO PERFORM AN ON-SITE INVESTIGATION ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 6TH, USING PHOTOS AND POLICE REPORT MEASUREMENTS.  THE METER SET ASSEMBLY WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, WHEN, UNRELATED TO THE INCIDENT, THE PROPERTY OWNER ELECTED TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE RATHER THAN MAKE REPAIRS TO A LEAKING YARD LINE.    THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED LATE TO THE DOT AND CPUC AS A RESULT OF ERRORS IN COMMUNICATING INCIDENT SPECIFICS.

BILLY GRIGSBY WAS ATTEMPTING TO REPAIR A WATERLINE LEAK AT 8016 MAIN STREET IN CAMPBELLSBURG, KENTUCKY.  MR. GRIGSBY INDICATED HE WAS DIGGING BY HAND AND COULD NOT GET A DEEP ENOUGH HOLE TO FIND THE WATERLINE.  MR. GRIGSBY SAW A BACK-HOE DOWN THE STREET FROM WHERE HE WAS WORKING.  MR. CHARLES MOORE WAS THE OWNER/OPERATOR OF THE BACK-HOE.  MR. GRIGSBY ASKED MR. MOORE IF HE WOULD DIG THE WATERLINE UP SO HE COULD MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.  MR. MOORE SAID YES AND DROVE THE BACK-HOE TO THE JOB SITE.    AS MR. MOORE WAS DIGGING, THE BUCKET OF THE BACK-HOE STRUCK AND PULLED IN TWO, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE FEEDING 8016 MAIN STREET.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT AT THAT TIME HE CALLED TO AN OFFICE IN TOWN AND ASKED WHAT THE NUMBER FOR LG&E WAS.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT ONCE HE RECEIVED THE NUMBER HE CALLED LG&E TO REPORT THE DIG-IN.    MR. GRIGSBY AND MR. MOORE BOTH STATED THAT THEY COULD SMELL A SLIGHT ODOR OF NATURAL GAS BUT, COULD NOT HEAR IT BLOWING.  MR. MOORE STATED THAT WHEN HE STRUCK THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE HE STOPPED DIGGING AND SHUT THE BACK-HOE OFF AND LEFT IT IN PLACE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT AFTER THE DIG-IN, HE RETURNED TO A SHOP DOWN THE STREET.  MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT AFTER THE DIG-IN, HE RETURNED TO A SECOND HOLE THAT HE HAD ALREADY DUG.    MR. GRIGSBY STATED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL A WATER VALVE ON A CHURCHS WATERLINE IN THE SECOND HOLE, WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED DESTROYING THE CHURCH.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPLOSION.    THE HENRY COUNTY 911 DISPATCH RECEIVED A CALL REPORTING THE EXPLOSION AT 2:37PM.  THE CAMPBELLSBURG FIRE AND RESCUE WAS DISPATCHED AT 2:38PM.  THE LG&E CREW ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 2:47PM.  THE LG&E CREW IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE OFF TO 8016 MAIN STREET.  THE CREW THEN SHUT THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE OFF TO THE CHURCH AND THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR.    THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS DID POINT TO NATURAL GAS AS THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION.  A JOINT INVESTIGATION WAS HELD THE NEXT DAY, APRIL 20, 2006 WITH LG&E, INDIANA INSURANCE COMPANY, THE KENTUCKY STATE POLICE, THE KENTUCKY STATE FIRE MARSHALLS OFFICE AND FEDERAL ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS.  INVESTIGATORS FROM THE KENTUCKY PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WERE ALSO ON SCENE.    THE JOINT INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE NATURAL HAS SERVICE GOING TO 8016 MAIN STREET HAD BEEN RE-LINED AND WAS  INCH PLASTIC SERVICE INSIDE OF A 1  INCH BARE STEEL LINE.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC SERVICE HAD BEEN PULLED IN TWO BY THE BACK-HOE.  THERE WAS A 6 INCH TERRACOTTA TILE DRAIN PIPE RUNNING FROM THE CHURCH TO THE MAIN SEWER LINE THAT RAN PERPENDICULAR TO THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE.  NEAR THE POINT WHERE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS PULLED APART, THE DRAIN PIPE WAS ALSO CRACKED.  THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THERE WERE TREE ROOTS ON, AROUND AND INSIDE OF THE DRAIN PIPE.    THE DRAIN PIPE HAD SEVERAL CRACKS AND AN APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH HOLE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAIN PIPE.  THE END OF THE PLASTIC NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS 14 INCHES AWAY FROM THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE DRAINPIPE AND WAS NEARLY IN-LINE WITH THE DAMAGED AREA AND HOLE.  THE ESCAPING 30PSI NATURAL GAS WAS BLOWING INTO THE DRAINPIPE AND FILLING THE CHURCHS BASEMENT WITH NATURAL GAS.  THERE WERE TWO FURNACES LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT THAT WERE PILOT LIGHT OPERATED.  ONCE THE NATURAL GAS FILLED THE BASEMENT AREA IT REACHED THE PILOT LIGHTS AND IGNITED.  THIS WAS A HIGH ORDINANCE EXPLOSION.    THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT MR. MOORE HAD NOT CONTACTED THE KENTUCKY ONE CALL CENTER FOR A BUD REQUEST LOCATED OF THE UTILITIES IN THE AREA.    THE INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH JOHN DAVENPORT, PASTOR CAMPBELLSBURG UNITED METHODIST CHURCH AND HIS WIFE SIRI, THAT THEY HAD NOT NOTICED OR DETECTED ANY NATURAL GAS ODORS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.    SERVICE RELINED  MARCH 17, 1987  GRADE TO SERVICE  26  INCHES  GRADE TO VALVE  20  INCHES  STOP BOX WAS VISIBLE AND OPERABLE"

THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, AND THE OPERATOR OF A NEARBY BULLDOZER, IMMEDIATELY CUT THE POWER TO THEIR EQUIPMENT AND ABANDONED THEM IN PLACE AND CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE.  THE GAS CONTINUED TO VENT FROM THE DAMAGED PIPE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, AT WHICH TIME IT IGNITED.  (IGNITION, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER KNOWN SOURCE, IS ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE BUILD UP OF STATIC ELECTRICITY.)  THE IGNITED GAS RAPIDLY CONSUMED THE D5 BULLDOZER AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE ARM OF THE TRACK MOUNTED BACKHOE.    DUE TO THE FIRE, AND THE FACT THAT THE DAMAGE TO THE 3 GAS MAIN WAS TO CLOSE TO THE TEE AT THE 6 STEEL GAS MAIN FEEDER TO ALLOW SHUT OFF, IT BECAME NECESSARY TO SHUT DOWN THE 6 STEEL MAIN FEEDING THE 3 PE MAIN.  UTILIZING THE MAPPING SYSTEM, THE NECESSARY VALVES WERE IDENTIFIED TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE 3 MAIN.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FAT THAT THE BURNING GAS WAS NOT THREATENING LIFE OR ANY ADDITIONAL PROPERTY AT THAT TIME, AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TOWN OFFICIALS, A DECISION WAS MADE TO LOCATE AND UTILIZE TWO EXISTING LINE STOPPER FITTINGS SHOWN ON THE WISCONSIN GAS COMPANYS MAPS AND WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMER OUTAGES.  THE FIRST STOPPER FITTING WAS LOCATED AND ACTIVATED.  THE SECOND FITTING WAS NOT LOCATED DESPITE EXTENSIVE DIGGING BECAUSE THE WRONG REFERENCE MARK WAS BEING UTILIZED IN THE FIELD.  WITH THE BLOWING GAS STILL UNDER CONTROL FROM CAUSING ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGE, A DECISION WAS MADE TO INSTALL A NEW 6 LINE STOPPER FITTING TO AGAIN MINIMIZE THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS.  UPON COMPLETION, THE SECOND STOPPER WAS ACTIVATED, THE FLOW OF GAS SHUT OFF AND EXTINGUISHED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:10PM.  AS SOON AS ACCESS TO THE DAMAGED AREA WAS AVAILABLE, THE EXISTING TEE WAS RETIRED AND A NEW 3 TEE AND ASSOCIATED MAIN INSTALLED.  GAS WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AND 39 GAS METER LOCATIONS WERE RE-LIT."

IN ADDITION TO 1612 BRIDLE DRIVE RESIDENCE THE EXPLOSION ALSO DAMAGED THE RESIDENCES AT 1608 AND 1616 BRIDLE DRIVE. A NORTHWESTERN EMPLOYEE READING METERS IN THE AREA HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND CONTACTED TWO ADDITIONAL NORTHWESTERN EMPLOYEES AS HE RESPONDED. ONCE ON SITE NORTHWESTERN EMPLOYEES BEGAN TO MONITOR THE GAS LEVELS IN THE AREA. NATURAL GAS WAS DETECTED IN THE 1612 BRIDLE DRIVE LOT. COMMUNICATION WAS ESTABLISHED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. THE SERVICE TO THE HOME WAS FUELING A FIRE IGNITED BY THE EXPLOSION. NORTHWESTERN WORKED WITH FIRE AND EMERGENCY CREWS IN ALLOWING THE FIRE TO BURN WHILE MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO SQUEEZE OFF NATURAL GAS TO THE AREA. EMERGENCY LOCATES WERE CALLED IN, CREWS ASSEMBLED TO DIG, AREA OF SAFE DIGGING WAS ESTABLISHED. AT 2:40 THE PIPE WAS SAFELY SQUEEZED OFF. THE EXPLOSION AREA WAS CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED THROUGHOUT THE EVENT TO ENSURE SAFETY OF CREWS. A LEAK IN THE MAIN LOCATED IN FROM OF 1612 BRIDLE DRIVE WAS LOCATED. A CREW BEGAN TO REPAIR LEAK, ANOTHER CREW BEGAN THE NO GAS PROCESS TO APPROXIMATELY 21 HOMES. REPAIRS TO THE MAIN AND SQUEEZED OFF MAIN WERE COMPLETED AT 8:15. AN AIR TEST WAS ADMINISTERED AND PRESSURE HELD. FINAL TIE WELDS WERE COMPLETED, SYSTEM WAS PURGED AND GAS WAS INTRODUCED. A FINAL LEAK SURVEY WAS COMPLETED WITH THE FI UNIT AND NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED. CUSTOMERS WERE RELIT AS ACCESS WAS GAINED TO THEIR HOME. NO TREATABLE INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT. IN NORTHWESTERN INVESTIGATION WITH DAVISON COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT ONLY HOUSES NOT PEOPLE WERE TRACKED IN THE EVACUATION. SINCE IT WAS DURING A WORK DAY MANY INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT HOME AND THE FOCUS BY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS WAS ON HOMES EVEN IF NO ONE WAS HOME INSTEAD OF PEOPLE. THE NUMBER 27 IS THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES EVACUATED NOT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. NORTHWESTERN IS A GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY. WE DO NOT ESTIMATE PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE OR HOUSE REPLACEMENT COSTS FOR A BUSISNESS. NOR HAS NORTHWESTERN HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SURVEY THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OF THE THREE HOMES. DID THEY HAVE COLLECTOR FURNITURE, BASEBALL CARDS, ETC? TO CORRECTLY ESTIMATE THIS NUMBER THOSE ITEMS WOULD BE NEEDED. THE NUMBER LISTED IN PRIVATE/PERSONAL PROPERTY DAMAGE IS A GUESS FOR THREE HOMES AND THE PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE HOMES. SINCE THE FORM REQUIRES A NUMBER AND WILL NOT ACCEPT A LIST OF WHAT WAS DAMAGED RATHER THAN THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT. JUNE 11, 2008 - ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE THE PIPE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS TESTED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA PUC'S INDEPENDENT EXPERT, JOHN F. KIEFNER, PH. D., PE FROM KIEFER & ASSOCIATES, INC. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2008, THE SD PUC STAFF RELEASED LAB RESULTS FROM STORK TWIN CITIES TESTING AND ON MAY 28, 2008 STAFF RELEASED JOHN KIEFNER'S FINAL REPORT. MR. KEIFNER'S REPORT ALSO ASSIGNED NO FAULT TO NORTHWEWSTERN ENERGY FOR THE INCIDENT. SPECIFICALLY, MR. KIEFNER'S REPORT STATED THAT"" - A MECHANICALLY CREATED GOUGE CAUSED THE PIPE TO FAIL. - THE MODE OF FAILURE WAS A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED BRITTLE CRACK THAT SEVERED THE BOTTOM THREE QUARTERS OF THE PIPE. - NO EVIDENCE OF TIME-DEPENDENT ENLARGEMENT OF THE GOUGE WAS FOUND. - THE DAMAGE THAT CAUSED THE FAILURE IS NOT NEW, BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH WHEN IT OCCURRED. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN MR. KEIFNER'S REPORT AND THE FORTHCOMING OF AN EXCAVATOR, NORTHWESTERN ENERGY HAS IDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT AS F3.9, EXCAVATION. NORTHWESTERN HAS ALSO UPDATED PART D.2 AND D.4 BASED ON ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INFORMATION OBTAINED WHEN THE PIPE WAS TESTED AND THE REFERENCED REPORTS WERE RELEASED. F3.9.D DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE LOCATE AND THE INCIDENT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE METHOD (FLAGS, PAINT, STAKES) USED TO MARK THE LOCATE."

SINCE THE LAST UPDATE METALLURGY TESTING HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  THE REPORT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE MONTANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.  THE REPORT STATES, IN SUMMARY, THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL PRINCIPAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE PIPE SEPARATION.  FACTORS INCLUDED EXTENDED LOADING OF THE PIPE, ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE PIPE, AND EXTERNAL FORCE.  THE FRACTURE APPEARS TO HAVE INITIATED AT A PRE-EXISTING ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACK ON THE SURFACE OF THE PIPE.  THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE OCCURRED PRIOR TO APPLICATION OF CATHODIC PROTECTION.  THIS CRACK WAS NOT SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO CAUSE FAILURE OF THE PIPE AND THAT SEPARATION WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SOME ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL LOADING THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE.  THE CAUSE HAS BEEN UPDATED FROM F7 - OTHER TO F2 - NATURAL FORCES ON THIS SUBMITTAL.  THE MONTANA PUBLIC SERVICE HAS CONCLUDED ITS INVESTIGATION.  NWE BELIEVES THAT THIS INCIDENT IS CLOSED AND THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER UPDATES FOR THIS INCIDENT.              5/4/09 - THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT.

WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO A REPORT OF GAS INVOLVED FIRE ON 4/24/2007 AT 43655 PIERPOINT TERRACE, LEESBURG, VA.  THE THREE STORY WOOD FRAME BRICK VENEERED TOWNHOUSE AT THAT LOCATION WAS VACANT AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WITH A FOR SALE SIGN IN THE FRONT YARD.  THE FIRE APPEARS TO HAVE ORIGINATED AT THE REAR OF THE TOWNHOUSE, BENEATH THE DECK AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE REAR BASEMENT ENTRY DOOR, IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE NATURAL GAS RISER, REGULATOR AND METER BUILDUP.   IT WAS NOTED THAT A THREADED STEEL GAS PIPE NIPPLE ON THE INLET SIDE OF THE 43655 PIERPOINT TERRACE GAS METER WAS MISSING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE AND WAS NOT FOUND IN THE DEBRIS.  THE CORRESPONDING OUTLET NIPPLE WAS STILL PRESENT.  THE MISSING NIPPLE ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO ESCAPE AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THE NIPPLE CANNOT UNSCREW ITSELF.  THE GAS LINE WAS INTACT AND HELD PRESSURE DURING A PRESSURE TEST (50 PSI FOR 10 MINUTES).  THE BURIAL DEPTH OF THE GAS SERVICE WAS AT 36 INCHES.  THE GAS WAS PROPERLY ODORIZED AND HAD BEEN CONFIRMED BY AN ODORANT TEST.  A SOIL SAMPLE WAS OBTAINED AND SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS THAT COULD NOT CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF AN ACCELERANT FOR IDENTIFICATION OF IGNITABLE LIQUID RESIDUES.  THE ANALYSIS DID CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF FOUR CHEMICALS THAT ARE STRONG INDICATORS OF AN IGNITABLE LIQUID RESIDUE, AN ACCELERANT SUCH AS GASOLINE, PRESENT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.  IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE NATURAL GAS LEAK, SUCH AS FROM THE MISSING NIPPLE, WOULD NOT RESULT IN A FIRE UNLESS AN IGNITION SOURCE IS PROVIDED.  THE FIRE APPEARED TO GO UP THE SIDE OF THE TOWNHOUSE AT 43655 PIERPOINT TERRACE IN A V-SHAPE FROM THE GAS METER.  THE FIRE THEN CAUGHT ON THE ROOF AND MOVED ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS, INVOLVING TWO OTHER TOWNHOUSE UNITS.  THE FORENSIC ENGINEERING CONSULTANT CONTRACTED BY WASHINGTON GAS, PROPOSES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE NIPPLE TO THE METER HAD BEEN REMOVED AND AN ACCELERANT WAS UTILIZED TO START A FIRE AT THE GAS METER OF 43655 PIERPOINT TERRACE.  NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE LOUDOUN COUNTY FIRE MARSHALL OR LOUDOUN COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE.

PRIOR TO CONCLUSION OF THE EXPERT'S INVESTIGATION, PIEDMONT SETTLED SEVERAL PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS WITHOUT ADMISSION OF LIABILITY ON THE PART OF PIEDMONT.  HOWEVER, AT LEAST ONE EXPERT CONCLUDED THAT THE CRACK IN THE CAST IRON VALVE (AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED) WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THIS PORTION OF THE LINE (UNDERNEATH THE DRIVEWAY AT THE ADDRESS OF THE FIRE) BY A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR OVER 20 YEARS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  NO CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED REGARDING THE SOURCE OF IGNITION OR THE INVOLVEMENT, IF ANY, OF WORK DONE INSIDE THE HOUSE ON PIPING AND/OR APPLIANCES PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR PROBLEMS REPORTED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE SAME LINE OR WITHIN THE SAME PROJECT LEADING PIEDMONT TO REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT THE OCCURRENCE WAS THE RESULT OF AN ISOLATED HUMAN ERROR ON THE PART OF THE THIRD PARTY INSTALLER APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO.

IN KEEPING WITH PIEDMONT'S STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE, FIRST RESPONDER PERSONNEL WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND CONFIRMED THAT A FIRE AND POSSIBLY AN EXPLOSION HAD TAKEN PLACE.    THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS STILL UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION AS PART OF THE OVERALL INVESTIGATION.  AS SUCH, WE HOPE TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN THE HOUSE LEADING UP TO THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, THEY ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TEST THE GAS APPLIANCES OR THE HOUSE PIPING, BUT HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SOON.

SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT #3.  THE CREW, AFTER WORKING SEVERAL DAYS, HAD EXCAVATED THE SITE, INSTALLED TWO 8"" LINE STOPPER FITTINGS (BUT HAD NOT TAPPED THEM) WHEN THEY WERE CALLED OFF THE PROJECT LATE IN THE MORNING OF MONDAY SEPTEMBER 17, 2007 TO COMPLETE A WELDING ASSIGNMENT ELSEWHERE. THE CREW SECURED THE SITE, PLANNING TO RETURN THE NEXT DAY TO COMPLETE THE TAPPING, CUT OUT  THE EXISTING 8"" VALVES, INCLUDING AN INSULATED DRESSER STYLE 323, 8"" COUPLING LOCATED IN THE ASSEMBLY, AND INSTALL TWO NEW 8"" VALVES AND A NEW WELDED INSULATOR COUPLING.  APPROXIMATELY 10 HOURS LATER AFTER LEAVING THE SITE, THE EXISTING 8"" INSULATED STAB COUPLING PULLED OUT RELEASING GAS INTO THE OPEN DITCH AND ATMOSPHERE.    AS PART OF THE POST INCIDENT REVIEW, THE FAILED MECHANICAL COUPLING WAS EXAMINED AND PHOTOGRAPHED.  IT IS APPARENT FROM THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE COUPLING WAS IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AT THE TIME OF ITS INSTALLATION IN 1963.  ONE END OF THE COUPLING WAS OVERSTABBED TO THE EXTENT THAT IT LEFT A MAXIMUM STAB OF LESS THAN 1 & 1/2 INCHES FOR THE OTHER PIPE END. PHOTOGRAPHS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT LABELED EXHIBITS 1 &2. SHOW THE CUT OUT COMPRESSION COUPLING WITH ONE END OF THE 8"" PIPE STILL IN PLACE AND OVER STABBED (NOTE LOCATION OF PIPE END) AT THE OTHER END.  A CORRECTLY INSTALLED COUPLING WITH A 7"" MIDDLE RING SHOULD HAVE A STAB DEPTH BETWEEN 3 AND 3.5 INCHES AT EACH END.  DISCOLORATION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE FAILED END OF THE COUPLING INDICATES THAT THE PULLED OUT PIPE MAY HAVE BEEN STABBED TO LITTLE MORE THAN 1 INCH OF THE DEPTH AVAILABLE TO IT.    ALTHOUGH  THERE IS NO ONE EVENT THAT CAN BE PROVEN OR SHOWN TO HAVE CAUSED THE FINAL FAILURE OF THE IMPROPERLY INSTALLED COUPLING, IT IS PROBABLE THAT REMOVAL OF RESTRAINING SOIL FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND THE WORK OF INSTALLING OF THE 8"" LINE STOPPER FITTINGS IN THE AREA OF THE COUPLING, CONTRIBUTED TO FORCES AND/OR RELEASE OF RESTRAINTS THAT RESULTED IN  THE ULTIMATE FAILURE (PULL-OUT).    AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SIMILAR IMPROPER COUPLINGS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN ITS DISTRIBUTION  SYSTEM AND THAT THE SITUATION ENCOUNTERED  WAS AN ISOLATED CONDITION.  THE COMPANY ALREADY ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE COMPRESSION COUPLINGS WHEN ENCOUNTERED AS WAS TO BE THE CASE IN THIS MAINTENANCE WORK.  HOWEVER, TO ENHANCE SAFETY, IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ITS CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES AND WILL BE INCORPORATING A REQUIREMENT TO STRAP COMPRESSION COUPLINGS AS SOON AS THEY ARE EXPOSED, EVEN IF THE WORK PROCEDURE ULTIMATELY REQUIRES THEIR REMOVAL."

A CENTERPOINT ENERGY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE AND STARTED SOME ROUTINE CHECKS IN THE AREA.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE THE MIGRATION OF THE LEAK A BUILDING EXPLODED (912 HOLLAND AVE.) THE EXPLOSION INJURED NINE PEOPLE, THEY ALL WERE TREATED AND RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL THE SAME DAY OF THE EXPLOSION.    ACE UTILITIES BORING AND TRENCHING LLC WAS INSTALLING A COMMUNICATION LINE FOR DEVINEY CONSTRUCTION, WHEN THEY BORED INTO OUR (CENTERPOINT ENERGY) 2 INCH STEEL MAIN LOCATED NEAR THE GAS LINE.  GAS MIGRATED FROM THE DAMAGED GAS LINE INTO THE DAMAGED SEWER LINE AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE BUILDING THAT WAS AFFECTED.    CENTERPOINT RETAINED THE SERVICES OF SAMMY RUSSO OF APR CONSULTANTS TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT. MR. RUSSO IS AN EXPERT IN NATURAL GAS OPERATION AND FACILITIES AND IN CONDUCTING FIRE AND EXPLOSION CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION, MR. RUSSO CONCLUDED:                      (I) THE EXPLOSION AT THE RILEY MEDICAL COMPLEX OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ESCAPE OF NATURAL GAS FROM CENTERPOINTS PUNCTURED TWO-INCH PIPELINE INTO THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIAS PUNCTURED SEWER LINE, WHICH IN TURN ACCUMULATED IN AN UNOCCUPIED DOCTORS OFFICE WHERE IT ULTIMATELY WAS IGNITED AND EXPLODED.  (II) THE EXPLOSION WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED HAD ACE UTILITY BORING AND TRENCHING NOT PUNCTURED BOTH CENTERPOINTS TWO-INCH NATURAL GAS PIPELINE AND THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIAS UNMARKED SEWER LINE. A BLOCKED SEWER GAS VENT IN ONE OF THE DOCTORS OFFICES ALSO WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN CAUSING THE EXPLOSION.  (III) CENTERPOINTS ACTIONS IN RESPONDING TO THE REPORT OF THE PIPELINE PUNCTURE WERE CONSISTENT WITH COMPANY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, RULES AND REGULATIONS OF GOVERNING REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, AND INDUSTRY NORMS AND BEST PRACTICES.  (IV) A SUFFICIENT VOLUME OF NATURAL GAS TO HAVE CAUSED THE EXPLOSION ACCUMULATED IN THE BUILDING IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AFTER THE PIPELINE WAS PUNCTURED AND CERTAINLY BEFORE CENTERPOINT COULD HAVE TAKEN ANY ACTIONS TO HAVE PREVENTED AN EXPLOSIVE VOLUME FROM ACCUMULATING.  (V) NOTHING CENTERPOINT DID OR FAILED TO DO WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE EXPLOSION FROM OCCURRING.  (VI) CENTERPOINTS PERSONNEL WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THEM TO EVACUATE THE OCCUPANTS OF THE NEW DIVA BEAUTY SALON.  (VII) THE RESPONSE TIME BY CENTERPOINTS CONSTRUCTION CREW WAS REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THE EXPLOSION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED EVEN IF THE CREW HAD ARRIVED EARLIER."

AT 4:04 P.M., A CON EDISON CREW, CONSISTING OF TWO GAS MECHANICS ARRIVED AT THAT LOCATION AND INITIATED EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR. UPON THEIR ARRIVAL, THE CON EDISON CREW WAS MET BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FDNY WHO REPORTED THAT THEY HAD CHECKED HOUSES ON THE BLOCK FOR GAS AND OBTAINED NO GAS READINGS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HOUSES EXCEPT FOR INSIDE THE BUILDING AT 48-15 WHICH THE FDNY VENTED. CON EDISON'S ""LEAD MECHANIC"" ENTERED THE BUILDING AT 48-15 WITH A MEMBER OF THE FDNY AND, UPON INVESTIGATION, CONFIRMED THAT THERE NO LONGER WERE GAS READINGS IN THE ATMOSPHERE INSIDE THE BUILDING.    CON EDISON'S LEAD MECHANIC THEN BEGAN A LEAK INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE ON 41ST STREET. OF THE SEVEN SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES TESTED OUTSIDE, FIVE WERE FOUND TO HAVE GAS-IN-AIR READINGS OF 20% TO 90%. CON EDISON'S CREW BEGAN REMOVING THE MANHOLE COVERS IN ORDER TO VENT THE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES; HOWEVER, THEY WERE UNABLE TO REMOVE THE COVER ON THE MANHOLE IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING AT 48-19 BECAUSE A CAR WAS PARKED ON TOP OF IT. AT 4:10 P.M., THE CON EDISON CREW CONTACTED THE GERC TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE IN MOVING THAT CAR. CON EDISON'S GERC CONTACTED THE 911 OPERATOR WHO DISPATCHED BOTH THE FDNY AND NYPD TO THE 41ST STREET LOCATION TO ASSIST WITH THE CAR REMOVAL. CON EDISON'S CREW CONTINUED WITH ITS LEAK INVESTIGATION AND REMOVAL OF MANHOLE COVERS UNTIL A RESIDENT OF THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 48-20 CAME OUT AND TOLD THEM THAT SHE SMELLED GAS IN HER APARTMENT. CON EDISON'S CREW PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION INSIDE THE BUILDING AT HER ADDRESS AND FOUND 0.5% GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HALLWAY. SHORTLY AFTER THEY COMPLETED VENTING HER BUILDING AT 48-20, THE CON EDISON CREW CALLED THE GERC TO REPORT AN EXPLOSION WITH FIRE AT 48-19 41ST STREET. THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION WAS 4:35P.M.    AT THE SAME TIME, 4:35 P.M., THE FDNY ARRIVED AT THE 41ST STREET LOCATION AND EVACUATED THE OCCUPANTS OF 14 BUILDINGS. A TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR THE EVACUEES WAS SET UP IN PUBLIC SCHOOL 199 LOCATED AT 39-20 48TH AVENUE. A WOMAN, WHO RESIDED AT 49-19 41ST STREET, WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND WAS TAKEN TO THE CORNELL BURN CENTER. THE FDNY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE AT 48-19 41ST STREET AT 5:15 P.M. ADDITIONAL CON EDISON CREWS ARRIVED AT THE 41ST STREET INCIDENT LOCATION; THEY SHUT-OFF GAS SERVICE TO 17 BUILDINGS AND PREPARED FIRE BANKS TO ISOLATE THE GAS IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT. AT THE SAME TIME THE CON EDISON CREWS EXCAVATED OVER THE SIX-INCH CAST IRON MAIN IN FRONT OF 48-19 41ST STREET AND DETERMINED THAT THE GAS MAIN WAS CRACKED AND LEAKING. THE CREWS INSTALLED A REPAIR CLAMP AT 9:29 P.M. AND SECURED THE GAS LEAK. THE CON EDISON CREWS THEN CHECKED THE BUILDINGS WITH THE FDNY AND, UPON FINDING NO FURTHER INDICATIONS OF GAS, ENDED THE EVACUATION AT 11:15 P.M. THE CON EDISON CREWS REMAINED AT 41ST STREET TO RESTORE GAS TO THE 17 SHUT-OFF BUILDINGS AND MONITOR THE AREA UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY.    THE SIX-INCH CAST IRON GAS MAIN AT 41ST STREET WAS INSTALLED IN 1927. IN JANUARY 2007, CON EDISON COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL LEAK SURVEY OF THAT GAS MAIN, AND NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED AT THAT TIME. CON EDISON REVIEWED ITS RECORDS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO LEAKS REPORTED OR DETECTED ON THE GAS MAIN OR ANY OF THE GAS SERVICES TO THE 14 BUILDINGS THAT WERE EVACUATED AT THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED 41ST STREET LOCATION. CON EDISON ALSO REVIEWED ITS RECORDS OF CUSTOMER CALLS TO THE COMPANY FOR THE SEVEN-DAY PERIOD PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS OF GAS ODORS OR GAS- RELATED PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA.    THE CRACKED SECTION OF GAS MAIN IN FRONT OF 48-19 41ST STREET WAS REMOVED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2007 AND SENT TO A METALLURGICAL LAB FOR ANALYSIS."

THIS NARRATIVE PROVIDE AS PER INSTRUCTION FOR PART G OF THE ABOVE REFERENCED FORMS.    OVER PRESSURES OF MINGO/HARVESTER GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.    ON JANUARY 31, 2008 AT 12:15 A.M. AN OVER PRESSURE ALARM, FROM THE ELECTRONIC METERING, WAS RECEIVED BY NORTHERN NATURAL GAS AND CALLED TO CONSUMER ENERGY FROM OUR MINGO TBS, LOCATED AT 12359 NORTH 59TH AVENUE WEST MINGO, IOWA 50168.  CONSUMERS ENERGY PERSONNEL RESPONDED AND FOUND THAT TWO EZR REGULATORS IN A WORKER MONITOR CONFIGURATION HAD FAILED IN THE OPEN POSITION AND THE PRESSURE TO BE 475 PSI. AT 1:15 A.M.  THIS TBS FEEDS 6 INCH PE PIPE 3408 SDR 11 PIPE WITH AN MAOP OF 100 PSI.    CONSUMER'S PERSONNEL SHUT DOWN THE REGULATOR STATION AND BEGAN TO VENT THE GAS.  AFTER VENTING WAS STARTED A SECOND CREW WAS CALLED TO CHECK OUR REGULATOR STATION AT THE HARVESTER DEVELOPMENT, LOCATED NEAR THE CRONER OF W100TH STREET NORTHAND HIGHWAY 330.  THE PRESSURE AT THIS STATION HAD PEGGED THE PRESSURE GAGE AT 160 PSI.  CREW 2 BEGAN VENTING GAS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT 2 A.M.  THIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 4 INCH, 2 INCH AND 1 INCH PE PIPE 3408 SDR 11 WITH AN MAOP OF 60 PSI.  DURING VENTING HOUSE REGULATORS WERE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY WERE VENTING AND ALL REGULATORS APPEARED NORMAL.    CREW 3 WAS DISPATCHED AT 6:30 A.M. AND BEGAN VENTING GAS AT A FARM TAP CENTRALLY LOCATED ALONG THE TRANSMISSION LINE.    CREW 4 ARRIVED AT 8 A.M. AND BEGAN VENTING GAS AT THE DISTRIBUTION TBS AT HARVESTER.  GAGES THAT HAD BEEN PEGGED WERE CHANGED.    WITH THE PRESSURE IN THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AT 300 PSI CONSUMERS CHECKED ALL FARM TAP METERS DOWN STREAM SIDES AND FOUND PRESSURES TO THE HOUSE TO BE NORMAL.  SPOT CHECKS WERE TAKEN ON THE DOWN STREAM SIDE OF METERS ON OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND ALL CHECKS WERE NORMAL FOR PRESSURE GOING INTO HOUSES.    WHEN PRESSURE REACHED 75 PSI AT THE TBS AT HARVESTER THE STATION WAS LOCKED IN AND LINE PACK WAS USED TO FEED THE CONSUMERS.    3 P.M. PRESSURE WAS DOWN TO 100 PSI AT THIS TIME A SHUT IN TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR ONE HOUR WITH NO LOSS OF PRESSURE DURING THAT HOUR.  GAS WAS TURNED BACK ON AND SHUT IN TEST WERE PERFORMED ON THE HOUSES.    4 P.M. PRESSURE WAS RESTORED TO HARVESTER TBS AND REGULATORS CHECKED.  GASKETS WERE DAMAGED ON ONE SIDE OF THE DUAL FEED WORKER MONITOR SYSTEMS FISHER 299H REGULATORS.  THIS SIDE WAS LOCKED OUT AND THE SYSTEM WAS OPERATED OFF OF THE ALTERNATE SIDE.    5 P.M. MINGO TBS CREWS RESTORED HIGH PRESSURE FEED TO MINGO STATION LEAVING MALFUNCTIONING REGULATORS LOCKED OUT.  CREWS CHECKED FUNCTION OF FISHER EZR REGULATORS ON OPPOSITE SIDE OF DUAL RUN AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT REGULATORS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WOULD ALSO BE LOCKED OUT AND THAT A FISHER 627 THAT FEEDS THE VORTEX HEATER WOULD FEED SYSTEM FOR THE NIGHT.    FEBRUARY 1, 2008 AN INFRARED LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED BY IOWA ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL UTILITIES.  THESE SURVEYS ARE PLANNED TO BE CONDUCTED MONTHLY FOR MINIMUM OF THE NEXT 90 TO 120 DAYS.    REGULATORS AT HARVESTER TBS WERE REPAIRED.  EZR REGULATORS AT MINGO WERE ALSO TAKEN APART FOR REPAIR.  THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN MATTER IN THE REGULATORS.  DIAPHRAGMS APPEARED INTACT BUT WERE REPLACED.    CONTACT WAS MADE WITH EAGLE PIPE, MANUFACTURES OF 3408 SDR 11 PIPE.  MINIMUM BURST FOR THIS PIPE IS 504 PSI.  EAGLE INFORMED CONSUMERS THAT THE PIPE REGAINS IT STRENGTH WHEN EXCESSIVE PRESSURE IS RELIEVED FROM THE PIPE AND PIPE IS OPERATED AT NORMAL PRESSURES.  EAGLE DECLINED TO PUT THIS IN WRITING.    FEBRUARY 2, 2008 CONSUMERS PERFORMED A SHUT IN TEST ON OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR ONE HOUR.  STARTING AND ENDING PRESSURES WAS 19.2 PSI.    AT THIS TIME CONSUMER PLANS TO ADD RELIEF TO OUR MINGO STATION AND CHANGE REGULATORS AND CONTINUE INFRARED LEAK SURVEYS."

THE PIPELINE WAS MOVED TO THE EAST BY TWO FEET AND LOWERED BY 18 INCHES DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW RETAINING WALL. THE FAILURE/RELEASE WAS AN ACETYLENE GIRTH WELD THAT SPLIT OPEN ON THE WESTSIDE OF THE PIPELINE. THE WELD WAS NEXT TO A PERPENDICULAR TRENCH THAT WAS DUG TO INSTALL A WATER LINE, WHICH PASSED UNDER THIS PIPELINE. THERE WAS A RETAINING WALL THAT WAS BUILT APPROXIMATELY SIX FEET TALL PARALLEL TO THIS PIPELINE. ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION TOOK PLACE IN THE SUMMER OF 2007. THE DAY OF FAILURE WAS WARM 45 DEGREES. THE WEATHER PRIOR TO THIS WAS COLD WITH SOME DAYS BELOW ZERO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FORCES THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE THE REASON FOR FAILURE. THE WELD WAS REPAIRED BY SHUTTING IN THE EFFECTED LINE SECTION AND A NEW SECTION OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED. THE RESULT OF SHUTTING IN THIS LINE SECTION CAUSED APPROXIMATELY 5200 CUSTOMERS TO HAVE THEIR GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTED. THE WELD IS BEING SENT TO STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FOR FAILURE TESTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. NORTH DAKOTA OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY OFFICER AL MOCH WAS KEPT INFORMED THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. AFTER THE EVENT WAS UNDER CONTROL AN ESTIMATE WAS MADE FOR THE REPAIRS AND RECOVERY OF CUSTOMERS. THE REPAIRS WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $15,000 AND THE RECOVERY COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AT $335,000. THE HIGH COST IS DUE TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO BE BROUGHT IN TO RELIGHT ALL THE CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELY FASHION. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, MDU IS FILING THIS REPORT. A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS CALLED IN ON FEB. 4TH, 2008 @ 1:20 PM REPORT #861454. 4/6/08 INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 1950'S VINTAGE OXYACETYLENE WELD HAD INSUFFICIENT PENETRATION AND FAILED DUE TO AN EXTERNAL FORCE, WHICH COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.

THE FAILURES ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN 1,700 RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS WITHOUT NATURAL GAS SERVICE. THE MAKE-UP OF THE STATION CONSISTED OF TWO, FULL CAPACITY, PARALLEL RUNS, OF 2"", TYPE FG-76-75 MOONEY REGULATORS. OVER PRESSURE PROTECTION FOR THE REGULATORS WAS PROVIDED BY A FISHER, TYPE 63EG, 6"" RELIEF VALVE. THE STATION IS FED BY A 475 MAOP SYSTEM AD SUPPLIES THE COMMUNITY OF HAYWARD WITH A 60 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.AFTER REVIEW OF RECORDED DATA, INTERVIEWS WITH PERSONNEL INVOLVED AND EXAMINATION OF EQUIPMENT, THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE OCCURRED. AT AROUND 5 AM ON THE MORNING OF THE FAILURE, THE PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN AT THE HAYWARD DISTRIBUTION REGULATION FACILITY BEGAN TO FAIL. THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PRESSURE BEGAN TO INCREASE UNTIL THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE BEGAN TO RELIEVE AT APPROXIMATELY 5:30 AM. THE RELIEF VALVE CONTINUED TO RELIEVE BUT DID NOT RE-SEAT ITSELF WHEN THE PRESSURE GOT BACK DOWN TO 60 PSIG. WITH THE RELIEF VALVE CONTINUING TO RELIEVE, THE PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO FALL AT WHICH POINT AT APPROXIMATELY 6:39 AM, CUSTOMERS BEGAN TO CONTACT WE ENERGIES THAT THEY WERE WITHOUT GAS. WE-ENERGIES GAS CONTROL CENTER HAD ALREADY RESPONDED TO A LOW PRESSURE ALARM RECEIVED AT 5:50 AM WITH THE DISPATCHING OF A FIRST RESPONDER. UPON ARRIVAL, THE FIRST RESPONDER STATED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE WAS BLOWING. KNOWING THAT CUSTOMERS WERE REPORTING NO GAS AND GAS CONTROL CONFIRMING ZERO PRESSURE, THE RESPONDER WAS INSTRUCTED TO SHUT THE STATION DOWN. THE PROCESS OF CHECKING THE STATION EQUIPMENT FOR THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE BEGAN. THE STATION REGULATORS WERE DISMANTLED AND NEW RUBBER GOODS INSTALLED BY APPROXIMATELY 11 AM. A NEW RELIEF VALVE WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND WAS INSTALLED BY APPROXIMATELY 3:30 PM. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF REGULATION FAILURE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE PASSAGE OF DUST/DEBRIS THROUGH THE STATION PLUGGING BOTH THE PRIMARY FILTER AND ERODING THE RUBBER PRODUCTS IN THE REGULATOR.ON JANUARY 30TH, 2008, TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FISHER COMPANY, MR. THOMAS STEMRICH, PIPELINE PROGRAM SAFETY MANAGER FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN AND REPRESENTATIVES OF WE ENERGIES INSPECTED THE FAILED RELIEF VALVE. THE INSPECTION REVEALED THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PIPELINE DUST/DEBRIS WAS FOUND IN THE PILOTS. A SUMMARY OF THE INVESTIGATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FISHER RESULTED IN THE BELIEF BY FISHER AND WE ENERGIES PERSONNEL, THAT THE DEBRIS THAT GOT INTO THE PILOTS DID NOT ALLOW LOADING PRESSURE TO CLOSE THE MAIN BODY OF THE RELIEF.WE-ENERGIES AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT HAS TAKEN THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF A RE-OCCURRING FAILURE. A STATION FILTER WITH A 10 MICRON FILTERING CAPABILITY WAS INSTALLED AT THE INLET AT THE INLET OF THE STATION AND ANOTHER FILTER IN THE SUPPLY TO THE PILOT OF THE RELIEF VALVE. IN ADDITION, THE STATION REGULATION WAS REPLACED WITH AN OPERATOR-MONITOR CONFIGURATION SUPPORTED WITH A FULL CAPACITY RELIEF DEVICE. AN INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO REVIEW NOT ONLY THE FAILURE BUT OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY GET CUSTOMERS BACK ON SERVICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. A MUTUAL AID PROCESS WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING THIS OUTAGE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE CUSTOMERS BACK ON SERVICE BEFORE MIDNIGHT THAT SAME DAY WITH ALL THE REMAINING TURNED BACK ON BY 10AM THE FOLLOWING DAY EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE ""COULD NOT GET INS"" REMAINING. ARRANGMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THOSE REMAINING CUSTOMERS.THE MANUFACTURER OF THE RELIEF VAVLE CONTINUES TO REVIEW THE RELIEF FAILURE MODE.

LUEDERS SUPERVISOR CODES AND STANDARDS	6166322646	LUEDERSJ@DTEENERGY.COM	"AT 14:56 ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008, MICHCON RECEIVED A REPORT OF A GAS LEAK INSIDE A TWO-STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY STREET SE, ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEALTHY AND ETHEL AVENUE.  THE CALLER REPORTED A STRONG ODOR OF GAS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING.  A MICHCON TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE ADDRESS AT 14:59, AND ARRIVED AT 15:21.  A SECOND GAS LEAK REPORT WAS RECEIVED AT 15:04 FOR THE SAME BUILDING; THIS CALLER ALSO REPORTED A STRONG GAS ODOR IN THE BASEMENT BUT ALSO AN ODOR OF GAS IN HIS BUSINESS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.      UPON ARRIVAL, THE MICHCON TECHNICIAN ENTERED THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING AND BEGAN CHECKING FOR THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS.  FINDING NO COMBUSTIBLE GAS READINGS ON THE FIRST FLOOR, THE TECHNICIAN CHECKED AROUND THE DOORWAY LEADING TO THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING TO CONTINUE HIS INVESTIGATION IN THE BASEMENT WHERE THE ODOR INTENSITY HAD BEEN REPORTED AS BEING STRONGEST.  THE BASEMENT DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLOOR STAIRWELL WAS CLOSED, AND THE TECHNICIAN CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS AROUND THE FRAME AND AT THE BASE OF THE CLOSED DOOR.  FINDING NO INDICATIONS OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS, THE TECHNICIAN OPENED THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY HIS GAS DETECTOR REGISTERED A READING OF 4% GAS CONCENTRATION AND RISING.  WHILE TURNING TO EXIT THE BUILDING, THE TECHNICIAN WAS STRUCK BY A RUSH OF HEATED GASES AND DEBRIS.  AN EXPLOSION LEVELED THE TWO-STORY STRUCTURE, DAMAGING NEARBY BUILDINGS AND STREWING DEBRIS ACROSS THE INTERSECTION OF WEALTHY AND ETHEL.  A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GRAND RAPIDS FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 15:40 ADVISING MICHCON THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED ON WEALTHY STREET, BUT THAT THEY HAD NO ADDRESS.    MICHCON CREWS BEGAN ARRIVING ON THE SCENE AT 15:48.  COMBUSTIBLE GAS READINGS WERE FOUND IN SEVERAL ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND IN SOME OF THE SEWER LINES IN WEALTHY STREET EAST AND WEST OF ETHEL.  HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF COMBUSTIBLE GAS WERE FOUND NEAR THE PARKING AREA ALONG THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND ALONG THE WALLS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF WEALTHY STREET, ACROSS FROM 1500-1502 WEALTHY.  MICHCON FOUND A CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK WITH APPROXIMATELY 1/4-INCH OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PIPE ENDS ON A 6 CAST IRON MAIN IN WEALTHY STREET, WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPAIRED AT 21:14 USING A BOLT-ON STAINLESS STEEL CLAMP.  AT 23:30, MICHCON SHUT DOWN THE MAINS IN THE INTERSECTION AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  THE 1-INCH COPPER SERVICE LINE TO 1500-1502 WEALTHY WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE MAIN AT 23:36, BUT DUE TO CONTINUING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEBRIS MICHCON WAS UNABLE TO LEAK TEST OR  RECOVER THE REMNANTS OF THE SERVICE LINE AT THAT TIME.    MICHCON GAVE TELEPHONIC NOTICE TO THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION IN LANSING AT 16:31 AND TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 16:44.     FIVE PEOPLE, INCLUDING FOUR BUILDING OCCUPANTS AND MICHCONS TECHNICIAN, WERE TRANSPORTED TO LOCAL HOSPITALS.  MICHCONS SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED AND THE REST WERE RELEASED LATER THAT DAY.    MICHCON PERFORMED A SUCCESSFUL LEAK TEST OF THE SERVICE LINE AT NORMAL 2 PSIG OPERATING PRESSURE ON MARCH 20, 2008, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF 1-INCH COPPER PIPE BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE BUILDING, 2 FEET OF 1-INCH COATED STEEL PIPE WHICH SERVED AS THE BUILDING ENTRANCE, AND A 1-INCH COUPLING OUTSIDE THE BUILDING WALL CONNECTING THE TWO PIPING MATERIALS.  NO LEAKAGE WAS FOUND ON THE SERVICE LINE.    THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND THE SOURCE OF THE GAS HAVE NEVER BEEN DETERMINED.  ON MARCH 20, 2008, A SEGMENT OF THE BROKEN 6-INCH CAST IRON MAIN FOUND ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008, INCLUDING THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL FRACTURE SEALED BY THE STAINLESS STEEL CLAMP, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM WEALTHY STREET.  LABORATORY EXAMINATION OF THE 6-INCH PIPE REMOVED FROM THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1500-1502 WEALTHY STREET SE REVEALED IT TO BE GREY CAST IRON WITH A COMPLETE CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK, THE RESULT OF A SINGLE OVERLOAD EVENT.  THE FRACTURE FACES EXHIBITED GRAPHITIC CORROSION AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS UP TO DEPTHS OF 70 TO 80 PERCENT OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS.  THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPE UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS.  THE CONDITION OF THE FRACTURE FACES RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BREAK OCCURRED WEEKS OR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY, BUT METALLURGICAL TESTING WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE BREAK RESULTED FROM THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION OR IF IT OCCURRED JUST PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  BOTH POSSIBILITIES WERE DETERMINED TO BE EQUALLY LIKELY.    MICHCON AND SEVERAL OTHER INVESTIGATORY ENTITIES, INCLUDING FIRE OFFICIALS, INSURANCE ADJUSTERS, AND FAILURE ANALYSTS, WERE UNABLE TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT NATURAL GAS HAD LEAKED FROM FUEL PIPING INSIDE THE BUILDING AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY.  DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION WAS PUSHED FROM THE SURROUNDING STREETS AND ALLEYS BACK INTO THE BASEMENT WITHIN HOURS OF THE EXPLOSION, DAMAGING OR DESTROYING THE BUILDING FUEL PIPING IN THE PROCESS.  NONE OF THIS PIPING COULD BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF A GAS LEAK INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING, NOR COULD AN IGNITION SOURCE BE DETERMINED.  HOWEVER, ANALYSIS DID CONFIRM THAT A RELATIVELY MINOR LEAK FROM THE CUSTOMER FUEL PIPING INSIDE THE BUILDING COULD HAVE PRODUCED AN EXPLOSIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE BASEMENT WITHIN HOURS.    MICHCON WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FRACTURE OF THE 6-INCH CAST IRON PIPE OCCURRED PRIOR TO OR AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION AT 1500-1502 WEALTHY STREET SE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008.  THEREFORE, MICHCON CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXPLOSION WAS CAUSED BY NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM THE CAST IRON MAIN OR, AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY SOME FIRE AND EXPLOSION INVESTIGATORS, THE EXPLOSION RESULTED FROM THE IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM A CUSTOMERS FUEL LINE INSIDE THE BUILDING.  BOTH POTENTIAL CAUSES WERE DEEMED POSSIBLE; NEITHER COULD BE ELIMINATED.  THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS UNKNOWN."

THE CONTRACTOR STATED HE HAD PUSHED DOWN ON AN OLD PIPE BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR CONSTRUCTION WHEN HE HEARD A HIZZING NOISE AND SMELLED GAS.    GAS DISPATCH CATEGORIZED THE LEAK AS A GRADE 1 (GRADE 1 IS DEFINED AS A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS LEAK) AND SENT THE FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE. THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT 12:39 P.M. AND INSPECTED THE EXCAVATED AREA INDICATED BY THE CONTRACTOR. HE OBSERVED AN EXPOSED 2"" GAS LINE IN THE DITCH AND ANOTHER UNKNOWN BENT BLACK PIPE NEAR A NEWLY INSTALLED CATCH BASIN. HE FOUND NO INDICATIONS OF THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK IN THE EXCAVATION, ALTHOUGH HE WAS READING THE PRESENCE OF GAS ON HIS INSTRUMENT. HE PROCEEDED TO CHECK THE SURROUNDING AREA INCLUDING THE AREA ALONG THE WALL OF THE NEARBY CHURCH. HIS READINGS INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF GAS REMAINED THE HIGHEST IN THE EXCAVATED AREA. AT 12:44 P.M. HE RETURNED TO HIS VEHICLE TO CALL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE ON HIS VEHICLE RADIO.    WITHIN MINUTES, ADDITIONAL UNITS ARRIVED TO ASSIST WITH THE LEAK LOCATING EFFORT. THE AREA AROUND THE CHURCH WAS CHECKED AGAIN, BUT INDICATIONS POINTED TO THE EXCAVATED AREA AS A POTENTIAL LEAK SOURCE. HAND EXCAVATION AND EXAMINATION BEGAN AROUND THE TWO PIPES IN THE OPEN EXCAVATION TO CHECK FOR LEAKS. NONE WERE FOUND. WITH CONTINUED PROBING INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF GAS AND POSITIVE INSTRUMENT READINGS, THE ONSITE PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO DO THE FOLLOWING: CHECK ADJACENT BUILDINGS INCLUDING THE CHURCH AGAIN FOR THE PRESENCE OF GAS AND OCCUPANTS, PREPARE FOR AN AREA SHUT DOWN OF GAS SUPPLY ACCORDING TO THE EMERGENCY PLAN DEVELOPED FOR THE ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND, CONTINUE SEARCHING FOR THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK.    AROUND 1 P.M., THE TECHNICIAN INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT WAS CONTACTED REGARDING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION. RESEARCH REVEALED THAT THE EXPOSED SECTION OF 2"" BLACK PIPE WAS POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF A FORMER 2"" LINE IN 1968. FURTHER REVIEW INDICATED THAT A SHORT SEGMENT (STUB) OF PIPE CONTAINING A COMPRESSION COUPLING, THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN RETIRED, MAY STILL BE ACTIVE UNDER THE PAVEMENT TO THE NORTH OF THE EXCAVATION. GIVEN THAT INFORMATION AND LOCATION, THE SEARCH EFFORT WAS DIRECTED TO VERIFYING THE STATUS OF THE LINE AND LOCATING THE COUPLING. PROBING INTHE CONCRETE PAVEMENT BEGAN AT THE LOCATION GIVEN AND THE SECOND PROBE TAKEN RESULTED IN A BLOW OUT OF SAND AND GRAVEL MATERIAL INDICATING THE THEY WERE NEAR THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.    GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS UNDER UNEXCAVATED SOIL AND PAVEMENT AND NOT KNOWING THE EXTENT OF THE LEAK AREA, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE TAKEM: THE GAS DISPATCH CENTER WAS ASKED AT 1:16 P.M. TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE FROM THE FIRE & POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO CLOSE OFF THE STREETS TO THE AREA AND GAIN ACCESS TO THE UNOCCUPIED CHURCH. THE PROCESS OF VALVING OFF THE AREA BEGAN AND THE IMMEDIATE AREA WAS CLEARED OF UNNECESSARY PERSONNEL. BY THIS TIME, WE ENERGIES HAD A TOTAL OF 6 PEOPLE IN THE AREA.    AT APPROXIMATELY 1:20 P.M., NATURAL GAS THAT HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE LOCKED NEARBY CHURCH, WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE, EXPLODED AND DESTROYED THE CHURCH. ANOTHER BUILDING BEHIND THE CHURCH WAS ALSO DESTROYED BY THE SUBSEQUENT FIRE. SEVERAL OTHER BUILDINGS IN THE AREA ALSO SUFFERED DAMAGE DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE. THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION PUSHED ONE OF THE GAS EMPLOYEES AGAINST A NEARBY MOBILE COMPRESSOR INJURING HIM AND REQUIRING SEVERAL DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION. TWO OTHER EMPLOYEES WERE EXAMINED THE FOLLOWING DAY BY THE WE ENERGIES NURSE AND A CLINIC AND WERE GIVEN LIGHT DUTY ASSIGNMENTS DUE TO STRAINS AND OTHER MINOR INJURIES. A TOTAL OF THREE COMPANY EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION AND AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS IN O NE OF THE NEARBY HOMES WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN MEDICALLY EXAMINED. NEWS REPORTS INDICATED THAT SOME EMERGENCY PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN TREATED FOR SMOKE INHALATION.    POST INCIDENT REVIEWS, INTERVIEWS AND FURTHER EXCAVATION AND EXAMINATION OF THE BURIED PIPE INDICATE THE CONTRACTOR UNCOVERED A 2"" PIPE STUB THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THEY ASSUMED IT TO BE ABANDONED AND PUSHED DOWN ON IT WITH THE BUCKET OF THE BACKHOE TO MAKE ROOM FOR A NEW STORM SEWER. THE SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION TO THE PIPE CAUSED IT TO SEPARATE FROM A BURIED UPSTREAM INSULATED COMPRESSION STYLE COUPLING. THE PATHWAY OF THE RELEASED GAS TO AND INTO THE CHURCH IS NOT KNOWN BECAUSE THE SEPARATION OCCURRED UNDER PAVEMENT AND IN SOILS STILL FROZEN FROM WINTER CONDITIONS.    ALL SIX OF THE WE ENERGIES EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT UNDERWENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AND THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR ALL SIX."

THE INCIDENT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE PROVIDED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.     UPDATE MARCH 26, 2009 - FINAL REPORT  THE PLUG DISPLODGED FROM THE BODY OF THE STOPCOCK VALVE, CAUSING NATURAL GAS TO ESCAPE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND TO BE IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE. A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE RETAINING NUT WAS ENGAGED WITH THE RETAINING THREADS ON THE PLUG SHAFT WHEN THE STOPCOCK PLUG DISLODGED FROM THE BODY OF THE STOPCOCK VALVE. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE WERE INCONCLUSIVE."

The property owners representative took possession of the pertinent portions of the customer owned service line during the onsite investigation. The property owner's representative discarded the customer owned service line materials before a laboratory analysis could be completed.  Through its third party ""cause and origin"" experts, and one of its compliance specialists, Columbia conducted an onsite examination of the pipe and fittings and took photographs of the service line materials. The on-site inspections, coupled with the photogrammetric examination, identified the fitting as either a Dresser or a Normac compression elbow and indicated that an improper stiffener had been used in the plastic pipe. The investigation found that the plastic pipe had pulled out of the compression fitting. The plastic pipe did not show any signs of yielding.  The stiffener that was used in the plastic pipe did not have a flange (lip) on the outer edge. The flange on the stiffener is a key component for pullout protection in the design of both the Dresser and Normac compression fittings."

THE INVESTIGATION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE REGULATOR WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SERVICE LINE DETERMINED THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEFECTIVE OR OUT OF SPECIFICATION PIPE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CORROSION OR WALL THINNING OF THE SERVICE LINE AND NO SIGN~ OF GOUGING OR TOOL DAMAGE.  THE REPORT NOTED THAT FROST WAS APPARENT IN THE SOIL AT THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN AND CONCLUDED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE SERVICE LINE FRACTURE WAS SOIL MOVEMENT.

BOTH PARTIES WERE LIFE FLIGHTED TO METRO HOSPITAL AND WERE PLACED IN THE BURN UNIT.  ONE OF THE PARTIES PASSED AWAY ON JANUARY 29, 2009 DUE TO INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION.  SURVEY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD REVEALED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED PROPERTY DAMAGE TO APPROXIMATELY 15 PROPERTIES.  A LEAK SURVEY OF THE GAS MAIN AND SURROUNDING SERVICE LINES DEMONSTRATED THEM TO BE FREE FROM ANY LEAKAGE.  A LEAK SURVEY OF THE PERIMETER OF THE HOUSE REVEALED GAS AT LEVELS RANGING FROM 100% LEL (I.E: 5% GAS TO AIR) TO A NEGLIGIBLE PERCENTAGE GAS ALONG THE LENGTH OF UNDERGROUND HOUSE LINE, THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE, AND BACK WEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE.  AN ODOR SURVEY WAS TAKEN AT 37839 LAKE SHORE BLVD., THE PROPERTY NEXT TO AND WEST OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, AND WITNESSED BY BOTH THE PUCO AND THE EASTLAKE FIRE MARSHALL DEMONSTRATED THAT ODOR LEVELS WERE WITHIN CODE REQUIREMENTS.  A STEEL SERVICE LINE (1  ) WAS FOUND TO HAVE A 5/8"" PLASTIC SERVICE LINE INSERTED.  THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE IS BELIEVED TO BE INSTALLED IN 1975 PER MR. PITCHLERS DEPOSITION.  IN PREPARING THE SERVICE LINE FOR A PRESSURE TEST, A FRACTURE WAS DISCOVERED APPROXIMATELY 200 DEGREES AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE LINE AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE COUPLES TO THE METER MANIFOLD RISER UNDERGROUND.  A 6"" SECTION OF SERVICE LINE (TO INCLUDE THE FRACTURE) ALONG WITH THE RISER WERE REMOVED AND TAKEN BY THE EASTLAKE FIRE MARSHALL TO BE RETAINED AS EVIDENCE FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION (THEY WERE LATER TRANSFERRED TO DOLENCE ELECTRIC AND THEN TO GTI FOR ALL PARTIES TO TEST AND OBSERVE).  THE REMAINING SECTION OF SERVICE LINE WAS TESTED FOR 10 MINUTES AT LINE OPERATING PRESSURE AND WAS FOUND TO BE FREE FROM LEAKAGE.  APPROXIMATELY 15' OF UNDERGROUND HOUSE LINE EXTENDED FROM THE MANIFOLD, RAN DUE NORTH AND ENTERED THE FRONT WALL OF THE BASEMENT.  A LINE OPERATING PRESSURE TEST OF THE UNDERGROUND HOUSE LINE DEMONSTRATED THE LINE TO BE FREE OF LEAKAGE.       DOMINION HAD A FRACTURE ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE FAILED METER RISER.  THE FRACTURE ANALYSIS CONSISTED OF A SEM (SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY) ANALYSIS.  THE RESULTS INDICATE A RAPID OVERLOAD FAILURE OF THE POLYETHYLENE PIPE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF HIGH STRESS APPLIED AT THE TIME OF FAILURE, WHICH DOMINION BELIEVES TO BE AN EXCESS OF FORCE APPLIED TO THE METER ASSEMBLY BY A SNOW PLOW."

BARKEI, MANAGER OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE"	4143894474	DAVID.BARKEI@WE-ENERGIES.COM	"ON SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2009, AT 2:17AM, THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE POLIECE DEPARTMENT (MPD) NOTIFIED WE ENERGIES CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER THAT THERE WAS A GAS LEAK IN THE AREA OF 2435 N.10TH STREET, IN THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. MPD ALSO SAID THAT THE MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT (MFD) WAS IN ROUT. WE WNERGIES CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TRANSFERRED THE CALL TO THEIR GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH WHO, AT 2:19AM, DISPATCHED A GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKER TO RESPOND TO THE GRADE 1 LEAK. WE ENERGIES GRADE 1 LEAKS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE.    AT 2:23AM, GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE MFD THAT THEY WERE ON THE SCENE AND THAT THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR THROUGHOUT THE BLOCK, NOT A SINGLE LOCATION AS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. THE DISPATCHER REPLIED THAT A RESPONDER WAS EN ROUTE AND ESTIMATED ARRIVAL TIME WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES.    AT 2:24AM GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE MPD THAT THEY WERE AT THE SCENE AND CONFIRMED A STRONG ODOR OF NATURAL GAS IN THE AREA. THE CALL WAS ALSO TO CONFIRM THAT WE ENERGIES WAS RESPONDING.    AT 2:28AM, THE MFD CALLED GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH THAT THE STRONG GAS ODOR WAS COMING FROM A BREAK IN THE STREET. GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH, PROVIDED WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE NATURE OF LEAK, DISPATCHED 3 ADDITIONAL GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AND A SUPERVISOR WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MINUTES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.    JUST PRIOR TO 2:45AM, THE FIRST WE ENERGIES RESPONDER ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. AT 2:45AM, HE INFORMED GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH THAT EXCAVATION WOULD BE REQUIRED AND REQUESTED ADDITIONAL HELP, AN EMERGENCY HOTLINE LOCATE, AND TO HAVE BARRICADES WITH FLASHERS BROUGHT TO THE SITE. GAS DISPATCH RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY AND DISPATCHED ANOTHER EMPLOYEE AT 2:50AM.    AT 3:03AM, THE SECOND WE ENERGIES RESPONDER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY SUBSEQUENT WORKERS AT 3:18AM, 3:23AM AND 3:25AM. THEY ASSISTED IN THE PROCESS OF PROBING FOR GAS LOCATION AND MIGRATION, DETERMINING WHICH VALVES AND THEIR LOCATION TO SHUT OFF THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AREA, AND CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF GAS AT BUILDINGS IN THE AREA. THE RESULTS OF PROBES AND GAS-IN-AIR MEASUREMENTS ALONG THE GAS MAIN, LEAD THE INVESTIGATION AWAY FROM LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT. THE 2 INCH PVC GAS MAIN WAS UNDER THE PAVEMENT, INSERTED IN AN ABANDONED 4"" CAST IRON AND SURROUNDED BY FROZEN SOIL CONTRIBUTING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF LOCATING AND STOPPING THE LEAK.    AT APPROXIMATELY 3:26AM, THE FIRST OF TWO AREA VALVES REQUIRED TO SHUT DOWN THE AREA FROM THE SUPPLY OF GAS WAS CLOSED. WITHING ONE MINUTE OF COMPLETING THE VALVE CLOSURE, THE TWO UNIT RESIDENCE AT 2435-37 N. 10TH STREET, EXPERIENCED AN INTERIOR EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE.    THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE RESULTED IN THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING. TWO OF THE OCCUPANTS WHO WERE IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION INCURRED INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION. THE EXPLOSION ALSO SEVERLY DAMAGED A SECOND SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE ADJACENT TO IT. THAT BUILDING IS CONSIDERED TO BE NOT SALVAGEABLE. THERE WAS ALSO MINRO DAMAGE SUCH AS BROKEN WINDOWS TO SERVERAL OTHER BUILDINGS INTHE IMMEDIATE AREA.    AT 3:37AM, THE GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKER, WHO HAD JUST COMPLETED CLOSING THE FIRST VALVE, CALLED GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH TO INFORM THEM OF THE EXPLOSION AND TO REQUEST MFD TO RETURN TO THE SCENE FOR ASSISTANCE. WE ENERGIES PERSONNEL AT THE SITE, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE MPD AND THE RETURN OF THE MFD, ASSISTED THE INJURED AND EVACUATED THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION, THE 2ND GAS VALVE WAS CLOSED SHUTTING OFF THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT. THIS RESULTED IN 41 GAS METERS BEING AFFECTED.    INCE THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE, WE ENERGIES CREWS, AIDED BY ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT DISPATCHED TO THE SITE, CHECKED BUILDINGS AND PROBED FOR ANY RESIDUL POCKETS OF GAS. SEVERAL EXCAVATIONS OF PAVEMENT AND FROZEN SOIL OVER THE MAIN REQUIRED BEFORE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS LOCATED. APPROXIMATELY ONE FOOT FROM A SERVICE TEE AND APPROX IMATELY 4 INCHES INTO THE INSERTED CAST IRON MAIN, THE 2 INCH DIAMETER PVC GAS MAIN WAS FOUND COMPLETELY SEVERED IN A CIRCUMFERENTIAL MANNER. TWO PHOTOGRAPHS ARE ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT TO SHOW IN-SITU CONDITIONS UPON FINDING THE BREAK. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MUCH OF THE INSERTED CAST IRON PIPE HAD BEEN DESTROYED IN THE PROCESS TO LOCATE THE BREAK. THE FAILED PIPE AND SURROUNDING CAST IRON PIPE WERE PRESERVED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.    A FORMER INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON FEBRUARY 10, 2009. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED THE FIVE GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE PRIOR TO AND AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, GAS CENTRAL DISPATCH DISPATCHERS, AND OTHER WE ENERGIES PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE INCIDENT REVIEW WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS WITH THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WHO HAD ALSO INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY OF THE EXPLOSION. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED WITH EACH OTHER, THE MFD, MPD, AND ANY PUBLIC ENCOUNTERED, PARTICULARLY RESIDENTS OF THE AREA.    A TECHNICAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILED PVC PIPE. PRIOR TO THE FAILURE, WISCONSIN WAS EXPERIENCING ITS COLDEST WINTER IN RECENT HISTORY. THE COLD TEMPERATURES RESULTED IN THE FROST LINES EXTENDING TO UNUSUAL DEPTHS, ESPECIALLY UNDER THE STREETS AND ROADS WHERE THE INSULATING AFFECTS OF SNOW COVER IS REMOVED. FROST WAS ENCOUNTERED AT THE DEPTH OF THE INSERTED PVC GAS MAIN WHICH WAS MEASURED AT 5 FOOT, 8 INCHES FROM THE TOP OF PAVEMENT.    THE CAUSE OF THE BREAK IN THE PVC PIPE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE RESULT OF THE FORCE OF THE FROST ON THE GAS MAIN DOWNWARD AND THE DIFFERENTIAL SUPPORT UPWARD OF THE EXPOSED PVC MAIN AND THE ADJACENT INSERTED MAIN ON EACH SIDE. THE PVC PIPE WAS SUPPORTED AT EACH END OF THE INSERTION WITH A GROUT EXTENDING ABOUT 4 INCHES INTO THE OPEN ENDS. THIS CONDITION CREATED A BEAM EFFECT AND RESULTED IN A SHEAR LOCATION AT THE ENDS OF THE BEAM. THE SHEAR FORCE EXERTED ON THE PIPE CAUSED IT TO FAIL IN A BRITTLE MANNER.    WE ENERGIES IS IN THE PROCESS OF PERFORMING ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEYS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN CFR 49, PART 192 AND WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM THOSE SURVEYS UNTIL WINTER CONDITIONS HAVE CEASED. IT IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF ACCELERATING ITS EXISTING PROGRAM TO ELIMINATE PVC GAS MAINS."

THE 2"" PE MAIN WAS DAMAGED WHERE IT CROSSED BENEATH A STORM DRAIN MAIN LINE. THE EXCAVATOR HAD A VALID LINE LOCATE TICKET AND THE SOUTHWEST GAS LINE HAD BEEN TIMELY AND PROPERLY MARKED. FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT INCLUDE: THE EXCAVATOR FAILED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE MARKED GAS FACILITIES WITH HAND TOOLS AT THE LOCATION OF THE BORE CROSSING; THE EXCAVATOR FAILED TO MEET WITH THE SOUTHWEST GAS REPRESENTATIVE AS REQUESTED; AND EITHER THE EXCAVATOR FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR VISIBLE AND OBVIOUS EVIDENCE - MANHOLE COVERS - THAT WOULD HAVE ALERTED A REASONABLE EXCAVATOR TO THE PRESENCE OF AN UNMARKED STORM DRAIN MAIN LINE OR THE EXCAVATOR RECOGNIZED THE PRESENCE OF AN UNMARKED STORM DRAIN MAIN LINE BUT THEN FAILED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE UNMARKED STORM DRAIN MAIN LINE WITH HAND TOOLS AT THE LOCATION OF THE BORE CROSSING. AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT, SERVICE WAS TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED TO AN ESTIMATED 1,751 GAS CUSTOMERS. SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE MAJORITY OF AFFECTED CUSTOMERS BY JANUARY 8, 2009 AND THE REMAINING AFFECTED CUSTOMERS BY JANUARY 9, 2009.

THIS REQUIRED CROSSING THE 8-INCH STEEL GAS FEEDER MAIN OWNED BY THE LAWRENCEBURG GAS COMPANY AT THE LOCATION IN QUESTION.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS USING A VERMEER 7X11 DIRECTIONAL BORING MACHINE TO INSTALL THE SERVICE.  THE CONTRACTOR HAD PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED THE DEPTH OF THE EXISTING GAS MAIN AT OTHER LOCATIONS MORE THAN 200-FEET FROM THIS CROSSING.  THE CONTRACTOR UNFORTUNATELY ASSUMED THE GAS MAIN WOULD BE AT THE SAME DEPTH IN THIS LOCATION, AND DID NOT EXCAVATE TO LOCATE THE EXACT DEPTH OF THE GAS MAIN AT THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION BEFORE BORING ACROSS THE GAS MAIN.  THE BORING HEAD FOUND THE CENTER OF THE 8-INCH STELL GAS MAIN, AND ONE OF THE ROCK BITS ON THE HEAD BORED A SMALL HOLE INTO THE SIDE OF THE MAIN APPROXIMATELY 0.25 INCHES IN DIAMETER.SINCE THE LINE COULD NOT BE SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO MANY CUSTOMERS, THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE WAS LOWERED TO APPROXIMATELY 40 PSIG SO THAT THE BORING HEAD COULD BE SAFELY REMOVED, AND A STAINLESS STEEL BAND WAS INSTALLED OVER THE HOLE TO ELIMINATE THE ESCAPE OF GAS.  AT THIS POINT, A DRESSER REINFORCING SLEEVE WAS WELDED OVER THE BAND TO CREATE A PERMANENT REPAIR, AND TO MAINTAIN THE MAOP OF THE PIPELINE.THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC, BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE DAMAGE, IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHAT THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGE WOULD BE.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR A COUPLE OF ITEMS, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THE TOTAL DAMAGE WILL BE LESS THAN $20,000.

UPON ARRIVAL BY WASHINGTON GAS FIRST RESPONDER, THE SERVICE RISER WAS TURNED OFF AND ADDRESSES 3426-3440 DONNELL DRIVE WERE EVACUATED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. WASHINGTON GAS CONTINUED TO CHECK INSIDE AND OUTSIDE FOR MIGRATION. DURING THESE CHECKS, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED. TWO FIREFIGHTERS REQUIRED BRIEF IN PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION. A VALVE WAS TURNED OFF NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF MARLBORO PIKE AND LORRING DRIVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE STRIP MALL. THE GAS MAIN WAS LATER SQUEEZED OFF AND CAPPED BEHIND 3416 DONNELL DRIVE. A PRESSURE TEST OF THE PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF THE CAPPED OFF LOCATION REVEALED THAT THE PIPE WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE AND A BLOWING NOISE COULD BE HEARD COMING FROM THE AREA OF AN ASPHALT PATCH IN THE PAVEMENT. WORKING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MARYLAND PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND THE PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND FIRE MARSHALL, WASHINGTON GAS DID A CAREFUL EXCAVATION, UNCOVERED THE TWO INCH PLASTIC GAS MAIN AND TRACED IT BACK UPSTREAM TO A LOCATION WHERE HOLES WERE FOUND. ELECTRICAL CABLES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. THE TRACER WIRE FOR THE GAS MAIN WAS FOUND TOUCHING AND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE HOLES. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE FAULTING ELECTRIC CABLES RELEASED CURRENT WHICH ENERGIZED THE TRACER WIRE, CAUSING IT TO HEAT UP AND MELT THE GAS MAIN IN SPOTS. THE HOLES IN THE GAS MAIN WERE NOT CAUSED BY RADIANT HEAT FROM THE FAULTING ELECTRIC CABLES. GAS ESCAPING FROM THE MAIN MIGRATED INTO THE BUILDING UNTIL AN IGNITION SOURCE IGNITED THE GAS AND CAUSED A LOW ORDER EXPLOSION. AN EXCAVATION OF THE AREA UNDER THE ASPHALT PATCH SHOWED THE LOCATION OF A NEW WATER LINE THAT WAS INSTALLED LONG AFTER THE GAS AND ELECTRIC LINES. THE BACKFILL IN THE VICINITY OF THE WATER LINE WAS INAPPROPRIATE, CHAFED THE ELECTRIC LINE AND PROBABLY THE TRACER WIRE.  THE CONTRACTOR WHO INSTALLED THE WATER LINE, GOLDEN SUN CONSTRUCTION, CREATED A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ENDING IN AN EXPLOSION WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED IF IT HAD BACKFILLED PROPERLY.  BASED ON A REVIEW OF MISS UTILITY RECORDS, GOLDEN SUN DID ITS EXCAVATION WITHOUT GIVING THE REQUIRED NOTICE OF INTENT TO DIG."

I ALSO NOTIFIED THE EAST DUBLIN FIRE DEPARTMENT, THAT WE WERE GOING TO CUT OFF A MAIN GAS VALVE TO REDUCE THE EXISTING 20' PSI MAIN PRESSURE BY APPROXIMATELY 50%) AND THEN WE WILL CUT AND CAP THE SERVICE IN THE STREET TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS. THE GAS MAIN IS A 2 1/4 "" CAST IRON GAS MAIN AND A ONE WAY FEED. THE WORK WAS COMPLETED BY APPROXIMATELY 0445 HOURS, WITH THE FIRE OUT.     THE HOUSE WAS A SMALL BLOCK HOUSE THAT APPEARED TO BE ON A CONCRETE SLAB WITH A WOOD ROOF. THE FIRE WAS APPROXIMATELY 3-5 FEET IN FRONT OF THE GAS STAND PIPE, NEXT TO THE HOUSE. THE FLAMES COVERED ABOUT 3 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND REACHED A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 3-4 FEET. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINED A SPRAY OF WATER ON THE FLAME DURING THE SHUTDOWN PROCESS.     IN MY CONVERSATION WITH MR. ALLEN, EAST DUBLIN'S FIRE CHIEF, HE STATED THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE AT AND IN THE HOUSE, AND ONE HAD LIT A CIGARETTE, AND THEN THE EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED, STARTING THE FIRE. BOTH PERSONS WERE TAKEN TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL, AND THEN TRANSPORTED TO A BURN CENTER IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA.     AFTER AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION TO COLLECT INFORMATION, I CONTACTED MR. BRUCE MORGAN WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, WHO IN TURN CONTACTED MR. ROBERT PACE, TO REPORT TO DUBLIN TO BEGIN A STATE INVESTIGATION. AFTER THE INITIAL ONSITE INVESTIGATION WITH MR. ROBERT PACE, I RETURNED TO THE GAS DEPARTMENT OFFICE AND NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, AND TALKED TO MS. WILSON, AT 1430 HOURS, NOTIFICATION NUMBER 907006.     DURING THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION, THE SERVICE LINE IN FRONT OF THE STAND PIPE, AND AT THE POINT OF THE FIRE, WAS UNCOVERED. THE 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN TRANSITIONED WITH A COMPRESSION COUPLING TO 5/8 ORANGE PE PIPE, AT SOME UNKNOWN PERIOD IN THE PAST. THE COMPRESSION COUPLING WAS SEPARATED FROM THE 3/4"" STEEL PIPE, ALLOWING 20 PSI GAS PRESSURE, TO BLOW UNDERGROUND IN SANDY SOIL. AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE SEPARATION OF THE COMPRESSION FITTING OCCURRED.    FINAL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION    ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2009, THE CITY OF DUBLIN RECEIVED NOTICED FROM THE GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, ON A HEARING IN REFERENCE TO A RULE NISI.    THE FIRST MEETING WAS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009 IN REFERENCE TO DOCKET   #30228 AND DOCKET #30452. THE JOINT CONSENT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON OCTOBER 27, 2009. DUBLIN PAID $30,000.00 IN PENALTIES TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.    PART OF THE CONSENT AGREEMENT WAS FOR DUBLIN TO UPDATE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS, USING A THIRD PARTY TRAINER, BY JULY 28, 2010. THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SECTION OF THE MUNICIPAL GAS AUTHORITY OF GEORGIA PROVIDED ALL TRAINING. SEE ATTACHMENT ON COMPLETION. DUBLIN'S NATURAL GAS SYSTEM WAS ALREADY UNDER CONTRACT IN THE MANDATED CAST IRON MAIN AND BARE STEEL SERVICES REPLACEMENT. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 3,340 L.F. OF 2 1/4"" CAST IRON GAS MAIN, ON JORDAN STREET, WAS REPLACED WITH 2,640 L.F OF 2 P.E. MAIN. ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE ALSO REPLACED WITH 5/8"" P.E. PIPING. DURING THIS PROCESS THERE WERE A TOTAL OF 4 INACTIVE SERVICES ABANDONED.    THE FINAL SETTLEMENT WAS MADE TO BOTH PARTIES INJURED IN THE HOUSE FIRE ON FEBRUARY 24, 2010."

THERE WAS ONE FATALITY; ONE REPORTED INJURY TO A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC; AND MINOR INJURIES TO NINE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF NEW YORK (FDNY) FIREFIGHTERS AS A RESULT OF THEIR RESCUE EFFORTS.     AT 3:2 1 P.M., ON APRIL 24TH A CON EDISON CUSTOMER AT 80-46 260TH STREET REPORTED THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING PARTIAL LIGHTS IN HIS HOME. AT 3:34 P.M., THE SAME CUSTOMER REPORTED A STRONG ODOR OF GAS OUTSIDE HIS RESIDENCE. A COMPANY MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION AT 3:56 P.M. AND ARRIVED THERE AT 4:05 P.M. HE THEN BEGAN TESTING THE STREET AREA AND MANHOLES. THE COMPANY MECHANIC FOUND HIGH LEVELS OF NATURAL GAS IN TWO SEWER MANHOLES IN THE VICINITY OF 80-50 260TH STREET, QUEENS; AND HE CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE. CON EDISON DISPATCHED BACKUP MECHANICS AND THEY ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT 4:42 P.M.     AT APPROXIMATELY 4:50 P.M., AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE OCCURRED AT THE HOME LOCATED AT 80-50 260TH STREET, WHICH WAS ADJACENT TO 80-46 260 STREET. THE 2 INCH, HIGH-PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN, LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF 260"" STREET, BETWEEN 80 AVENUE AND 81 AVENUE, WAS ISOLATED BY GAS OPERATIONS AT 5:05 P.M. BY CLOSING FOUR (4) VALVES. THE GAS MAIN ON 259 STREET WAS SHUT DOWN AT THE REQUEST OF THE FDNY DUE TO A FIRE IN THE ADJACENT HOMES AND AT 80-49 259 STREET (THE HOME BEHIND 80-50 260M STREET). AT 5:41 P.M., THE FDNY EVACUATED A11 21 HOMES ON 260TH STREET FOR SAFETY. THE GAS MAIN ON 259TH STREET WAS SHUT DOWN BY GAS OPERATIONS AT 6: 10P.M. BY OPERATING TWO (2) VALVES. AS A RESULT OF THE GAS MAIN ISOLATIONS, FIFTY GAS CUSTOMERS WERE INTERRUPTED. AT 6: 17 P.M., ALL SEWER MANHOLES WERE FOUND TO BE GAS FREE. AT 7:25 P.M., ELECTRIC EMERGENCY CREWS COMPLETED THE ISOLATION OF THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY ON BOTH AFFECTED STREETS.     ON SATURDAY, APRIL 25 &, AT 12:01 A.M., THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED BY THE COMPANY TO ALL CUSTOMERS ON 259 STREET, AS WELL AS TO THE CUSTOMERS ON 260TH STREET, WHOSE HOMES HAD NOT SUSTAINED DAMAGE. THE ELECTRIC SERVICE REMAINED OFF TO THE HOMES AT 80-46, 80-50, AND 80-54 260 STREET. THE ATMOSPHERE IN ALL BUILDINGS ON 259 AND 260TH STREETS WAS RECHECKED BY THE COMPANY TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WAS NO GAS, AND AT 12: 18 A.M. THE EVACUATION WAS ENDED. THERE WAS NEWS MEDIA ON LOCATION.     AS PART OF THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION, THE COMPANY RETAINED THE SERVICES OF LUCIUS PITKIN, INC. (LPI), AN INDEPENDENT, FAILURE ANALYSIS ENGINEERING CONSULTANT. SECTIONS OF THE TWO (2) INCH, HIGH PRESSURE GAS MAIN, THE GAS SERVICE LINE SUPPLYING 80-50 260TH STREET, THE TWO (2) INCH STEEL ELECTRIC CONDUIT AND THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES SUPPLYING 80-46, 80-50, AND 80-54 260TH STREET, WERE EVALUATED.     LPI FOUND A DIME-SIZED HOLE AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE TWO (2) INCH, HIGH-PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN. THE GAS MAIN WAS SITUATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR FEET WEST OF THE EAST CURB OF 260TH STREET AN APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF THREE (3) FEET. THE TWO (2) INCH, STEEL ELECTRIC CONDUIT AND THE GAS MAIN WERE FOUND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WHEN THEY WERE EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE HOLE IN THE GAS MAIN WAS LOCATED AT A POINT WHERE IT PASSED UNDER THE TWO (2) INCH, STEEL ELECTRIC CONDUIT HOUSING THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES SUPPLYING 80-46, 80-50, AND 80-54 260TH STREET. THE STEEL ELECTRIC CONDUIT HAD A CORRESPONDING HOLE IN THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION WHERE IT CROSSED THE STEEL GAS MAIN, THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES FAILED IN AN AREA APPROXIMATELY 19 FEET WEST (TOWARDS 80-50 260THSTREET) FROM THE LOCATION WHERE THE ELECTRIC CONDUIT AND GAS MAIN CROSSED. THE GAS MAIN, INSTALLED IN 1950, WAS FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION WITH NO CORROSION, SUITABLE FOR HIGH PRESSURE GAS SERVICE.     LPI HAS DETERMINED THAT A FAULT IN THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES MOST LIKELY ORIGINATED IN AN AREA THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 19 FEET FROM THE LOCATION WHERE THE GAS MAIN AND ELECTRIC CONDUIT PASSED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. AT THE FAULT LOCATION, THE TWO (2) INCH, STEEL CONDUIT WAS BENT UPWARD AND A COUPLING BETWEEN TWO PIECES OF CONDUIT HAD BEEN COMPROMISED BY CORROSION AND CONDUIT DEFORMATION. THE ELECTRIC FAILURE CAUSED FAULT CURRENT TO FLOW INTO THE STEEL ELECTRIC CONDUIT, WHICH ARCED ONTO THE NEARBY TWO (2) INCH, HIGH-PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN.     THE ARCING FROM THE CONDUIT TO THE GAS MAIN CREATED HOLES IN BOTH THE ELECTRIC CONDUIT AND THE GAS MAIN. THE ARCING ALSO CAUSED LOCALIZED DAMAGE TO THE INSULATION AND ONE CONDUCTOR OF THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES. IN AREAS UNAFFECTED BY THE ORIGINAL FAULT OR THE ARCING, THE ELECTRIC SERVICE CABLES WERE IN ACCEPTABLE CONDITION, ADEQUATE FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THE HOMES. ONCE THE ARC CREATED THE HOLE IN THE GAS MAIN, THE ESCAPING GAS TRAVELLED THROUGH PREFERENTIAL ROUTES IN THE SOIL AND SUBSURFACE FACILITIES, ULTIMATELY ACCUMULATING IN THE HOUSE.     THE EXTERIOR OF THE ELECTRIC CONDUIT EXHIBITED DAMAGE THAT APPEARS TO HAVE RESULTED FROM PAST EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE ELECTRIC AND GAS FACILITIES ON 260TH STREET WERE EXPOSED IN 1987 AS PART OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TO INSTALL WATER AND SEWER MAINS BENEATH THE ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICES. THE ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICES, LOCATED AT AN APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF THREE (3) FEET, WERE EXPOSED A SECOND TIME IN 2000, WHEN THE ROADWAY ON 260TH STREET WAS EXCAVATED TO APPROXIMATELY A FIVE (5) FOOT DEPTH BY AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RECONSTRUCTING THE ROADWAY. THE DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRIC CONDUIT IN THE AREA OF THE ORIGINAL FAULT AND THE POSSIBLE MOVEMENT OF THE ELECTRIC CONDUIT AND GAS MAIN IN THE AREA OF CLOSE PROXIMITY WHERE THE ARCING OCCURRED MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED WHEN THE EXCAVATION WORK WAS PERFORMED IN 1987 OR 2000."

THE PROJECT WAS SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY, AUGUST 15TH TO MINIMIZE CUSTOMER IMPACT DUE TO THE OUTAGE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS REBUILD.    A WALK THROUGH WAS CONDUCTED ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 14TH TO EVALUATE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND TO COMMUNICATE THE EXTENT OF THE OUTAGE WITH THE CUSTOMER. THE CONSTRUCTION CREW WOULD DISCONNECT THE FACILITIES FROM THE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND REBUILD THE METER SET. THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, A REGULATOR TECHNICIAN WAS SCHEDULED TO REESTABLISH GAS TO THE CUSTOMER.    THE CREW MET AT THEIR WORK HEADQUARTERS AT 6:30 A.M., LOADED THE MATERIALS AND HEADED FOR THE JOB SITE. ONCE ON SITE, THE CREW CONDUCTED A JOB BRIEFING THAT FOCUSED ON:  ENERGY SOURCES - CONTROLLING THE SOURCE OF GAS WITH VALVES  WORK PROCEDURES SPECIFICALLY WELDING  SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FIRE EXTINGUISHER, PROPER TOLS, WORK AREA CONDITIONS  PPE REQUIREMEMNTS - GLOVES, SAFETY GLASSES, HIGH VIS VESTS, WELDING APPAREL  STRAIN HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH REMOVING THE AL 5000 GAS METERS    THE EXISTING FACILITIES WERE CONSTRUCTED WITH TWO RISERS PROVIDING 90 PSIG GAS TO PARALLEL AL 5000 GAS METERS WITH A SINGLE DOWNSTREAM 461 REGULATOR DELIVERING 55 PSIG GAS TO THE CUSTOMER.    THE CREW CLOSED TWO INLET RISER VALVES ISOLATING THE METER SET FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SUPPLY. THE CREW BROKE THE UNIONS DOWNSTREAM OF EACH AL 5000 GAS METER TO BLEED OFF THE GAS. THE RISER VALVES WERE WELD-BY FLANGED GATE VALVES WITH 2"" 150 CLASS FLANGE CONNECTIONS DOWNSTREAM OF THE GATE. THE CREW CUT THE PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF THE FLANGE AND REMOVED THE AL 5000 GAS METERS TO HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO REMOVE THE FLANGE BOLTS.    THE CREW ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO USE AN IMPACT WRENCH TO REMOVE THE FLANGE BOLTS; HOWEVER, THEY COULD NOT LOCATED A 3/4"" X 1/2"" IMPACT WRENCH ADAPTER, SO DECIDED TO USE AN OXY-ACETYLENE TORCH TO CUT THE FLANGE BOLTS. THE CREW CHECKED FOR GAS BLEED BY AT THE INLET GATE VALVES TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE WORKING IN A GAS FREE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE TORCH AND THEN PROCEEDED TO CUT THE EIGHT FLANGE BOLTS. SEVEN OF THE EIGHT FLANGE BOLTS WERE REMOVED WHEN THE FINAL BOLT REQUIRED ADDITIONAL CUTTING TO REMOVE A BURR THAT INHIBITED THE REMOVAL OF THE BOLT.    THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THE RISER VALVES AND UNIONS. THIS PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF THE UNIONS HAD BEEN OPEN TO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES WHEN THE RESTRICTING ELEMENT ON THE DOWNSTREAM 461 DIRECT OPERATED REGULATOR OPENED ALLOWING THE RELEASE OF CUSTOMER LINE PACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS LINE PACK CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE TORCH AND IGNITED, RESULTING IN INJURIES TO AN EMPLOYEE.    MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THE BURN INJURIES WAS PROVIDED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. LATER THAT AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING, THE EMPLOYEE MADE THE DECISION TO GET ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AT A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION AND RELEASED THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE EXTENT OF HIS INJURIES INCLUDED FIRST DEGREE BURNS TO THE SIDE OF HIS FACE AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO HIS WRIST BETWEEN HIS GLOVES AND WELDING JACKET.    THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO THE RELEASE OF CUSTOMER LINE PACK DOWNSTREAM OF THE 461 REGULATOR. THE CREW THOUGHT THAT THE GAS DOWNSTREAM OF THE INLET RISER VALVE WAS COMPLETELY BLED OFF WHEN THE TWO UNIONS WERE BROKE AND THE GAS METERS REMOVED.    THE GAS IGNITION WAS NOT ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED AS A REPORTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE THE SOURCE OF GAS RELEASED WAS CUSTOMER LINE PACK DOWNSTREAM OF THE GAS METERS AND REGULATOR. AMEREN IP DID PROVIDE NOTIFICATION TO THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) OF THE IGNITION AND SUBSEQUENT MEDICAL TREATMENT THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, AUGUST 17TH. THE ICC STAFF, IN CONSULTATION WITH PHMSA CENTRAL REGION, STATED THAT THIS GAS IGNITION SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A DISTRIBUTION INCIDENT BECAUSE THE GAS WAS RELEASED THROUGH COMPANY PIPELINE FACILITIES WHEN THE 461 REGULATOR OPENED ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER LI NE PACK TO BLEED OFF TO THE ATMOSPHERE.    FOLLOWING THIS DISCUSSION THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO PHMSA AT 11:30 A.M. ON AUGUST 17, 2009. POST INCIDENT ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING WAS NOT PERFORMED DUE TO THE 32 HOUR TIME LAPSE."

THE REQUEST ALSO STATED IT WAS MARKED WITH A RED FLAG.    THE LOCATOR RESPONDED TO THE SITE ON THE EVENING OF 7/15. HE DROVE 1 MILE EAST FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED INTERSECTION WHERE THERE WAS A FIELD ENTRANCE AND COLE'S BACKHOE. THE LOCATOR COULD NOT FIND A SINKHOLE IN THE ROAD AND KNOWING THE NEAREST GAS FACILITY WAS 600' EAST, CLEARED THE TICKET. THERE WERE FLAGS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE FIELD; HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE INFORMATION FROM THE TICKET AND CONDITIONS AT THE SITE, THE LOCATOR DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXCAVATION WAS TAKING PLACE NEAR THE MAIN.     ON 7/16 WHILE INSTALLING NEW FIELD DRAINAGE PIPE ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE NORTH OF RT 16, COLE HIT AN UNMARKED 4"" STEEL GAS MAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30PM.     THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION HAS DETERMINED THAT COLE WAS EXCAVATING OUTSIDE THE EXTENT OF THE JULIE LOCATE TICKET AND HAD FALSELY OBTAINED AN EMERGENCY LOCATE. THERE WAS NO SINKHOLE FOUND AND THE LOCATION POINTED OUT BY COLE AS A SINKHOLE WAS APPROXIMATELY 380 FEET EAST OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION. THE LOCATION APPEARED TO BE WHERE A SWALE FROM THE FARM FIELD INTERSECTED THE ROAD DITCH AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CREATING A HAZARD WITH THE ROAD. THE DAMAGE OCCURRED ABOUT 130 FEET NORTH OF THE APPARENT NORTH ROW OF RT 16 AND OVER 100 FEET FROM THE RED FLAG THAT WAS CLAIMED TO MARK THE LOCATION OF THE REPAIR.    COLE CLEARLY EXCAVATED OUTSIDE THE EXTENT DESCRIBED ON LOCATE REQUEST AND DAMAGED THE GAS PIPELINE. AS STATED IN ICC JULIE ENFORCEMENT CASE 0188-09, EXCAVATING OUTSIDE OF THE EXTENT OF A VALID LOCATE REQUEST IS CONSIDERED THE SAME AS HAVING SUBMITTED NO REQUEST AT ALL, AND ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED CASE, COLES FAILURE TO PROVIDE PROPER NOTICE TO JULIE BEFORE BEGINNING EXCAVATION IN A FARM FIELD ON THE NORTH SIDE OF ILLINOIS ROUTE 16,  MILE WEST OF ASHMORE, ILLINOIS, AND OUT OF THE EXTENT DESCRIBED ON REQUEST #X1961030, IS A VIOLATION OF SECTION 4(D) OF THE ILLINOIS UNDERGROUND UTILITY FACILITIES DAMAGE PREVENTION ACT, 220 ILCS 50.     THE ESTIMATED COST AT THE TIME OF THE DAMAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY $35,000 AND THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION.  THE ACTUAL COST CALCULATED BY AMEREN CLAIMS FOR 3RD PARTY DAMAGE BILLING WAS LATER FOUND TO EXCEED $50,000.  THIS UPDATED COST WAS REPORTED TO THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION JULIE ENFORCEMENT STAFF AND THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED OF THE REPORTABLE INCIDENT ON 09/20/09."

Conditions were made safe at 20:24 on November 12, 2009. The remnant of the 3"" service tee was removed from the top of the main, and a full-seal stainless steel band clamp was applied over the 2-3/4""-diameter hole to complete the repair at 21:23 the same evening. The residents of the elder care facility were allowed to return at 23:45. </P>  <P>Supply to approximately 36 customers was curtailed due to the pressure reduction during the repair operation, and was completely restored early the morning of November 13, 2009. </P>"

THE ANALYSIS OF THE PIPE REVEALED THAT THE FUSION PERFORMED AND HELD PRESSURE FOR 29 YEARS WITHOUT ANY REPORTED LEAKS.  THE LABORATORY EXAMINATION OF THE PIPE INDICATED THAT THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THE PIPE SATISFIED STANDARDS AND PRACTICES FOR THE SIZE OF THE BEAD AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPLETENESS OF THE FUSION.

THE PRIMARY FACTORS ARE THE LOW STRESS CRACK RESISTANCE OF THE MATERIAL DEMONSTRATED IN THIS PARTICULAR ELBOW ALONG WITH THE BENDING STRAIN TO WHICH THE FITTING WAS SUBJECTED.  THE BENDING STRAIN COULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION, OR POST-INSTALLATION DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS OTHER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.    THIS INCIDENT BECAME REPORTABLE TO PHMSA ON DECEMBER 14, 2009 WHEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY FACILITIES WERE DETERMINED TO BE INVOLVED AND TOTAL PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS DETERMINED TO EXCEED $50,000."

A 2"" POLYETHYLENE (PE) MAIN AND A 2"" CAST IRON MAIN WERE IN SERVICE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY; BOTH WERE ISOLATED.  THE AREA WAS LEAK SURVEYED BY FI; NO GAS WAS DETECTED.  THE ODORANT LEVEL WAS TESTED AND FOUND TO BE DETECTABLE.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE 2"" CAST IRON MAIN WAS REACTIVATED AND RESURVEYED BY FI.  A LEAK WAS DETECTED AND THE LINE EXPOSED.  UPON INSPECTION, THE CAST IRON MAIN WAS FOUND TO BE RESTING ON THE GRAVITY SEWER SERVICE LINE TO THE STRUCTURE AND TO HAVE A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES FROM THEIR INTERSECTION.  AS OF THIS TIME, IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED IF THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE CAST IRON MAIN CRACK OR THE CRACK RESULTED FROM THE EXPLOSION.       EXISTING CAST IRON GAS LINE WAS DISCOVERED TO BE RESTING ON TOP OF SEWER SERVICE LINE WITH CIRCUMFERENTIAL HAIRLINE CRACK. IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED THE CONTIBUTING FACTOR OR FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE GAS LINE TO CRACK.    FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS NO INIDICATION OF A LEAK FROM THE MAIN PRIOR TO EIGHTY-FOUR MINUTES BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.

COMPANY PERSONNEL BEGAN EXCAVATING TO EXPOSE THE 1"" POLYETHYLENE GAS SERVICE SERVICING THE RESIDENCE. THE SERVICE WAS EXPOSED, CUT AND CAPPED. COMPANY PERSONNEL THEN BEGAN EXCAVATING FROM THE FIRST EXCAVATION TO EXPOSE THE GAS MAIN. AS THEY EXCAVATED TOWARD THE MAIN THEY NOTICED WATER ENTERING THE EXCAVATION.  THE SOURCE OF THE WATER WAS DETERMINED TO BE A WATER MAIN LEAK LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET BELOW AND TWO FEET LATERALLY FROM THE 4"" CAST GAS IRON MAIN.
